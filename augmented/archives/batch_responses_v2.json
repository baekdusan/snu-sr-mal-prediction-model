(총 35개)\n\n### A. BASIC TEXT STATISTICS\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| TXT_char_count              | numeric    | queries     | Number of characters including spaces. | Longer queries often indicate more complex information needs, which can increase tolerated latency. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces    | numeric    | queries     | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures true text length; correlates with reading/processing time and perceived task complexity. |\n| TXT_word_count              | numeric    | queries     | Number of space-separated tokens. | More words generally mean more constraints or details, affecting cognitive load and MAL. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length         | numeric    | queries     | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count. | Longer average word length can reflect more specific or technical content, possibly increasing acceptable latency. |\n| TXT_sentence_count          | numeric    | queries     | Count of sentences (here all are 1). | More sentences usually mean multi-step or compound tasks, which users may expect to take longer. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count       | numeric    | queries     | Count of punctuation marks (?,!,. etc.). | Punctuation can signal interrogatives, emphasis, or complexity, influencing urgency and expectations. |\n| TXT_has_question_mark       | binary     | queries     | 1 if query contains \"?\" (Korean question mark), else 0. | Explicit questions may be perceived as information retrieval tasks with clearer expectations on speed. |\n| TXT_special_char_count      | numeric    | queries     | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., digits, currency symbol). | Presence of digits/amounts often implies precise retrieval, which may change tolerance for delay. |\n\n### B. LINGUISTIC & SYNTACTIC FEATURES\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| LING_query_type             | categorical| queries     | {interrogative, imperative, mixed}. | Interrogatives (“뭐였지?”, “어디였지?”) vs imperatives (“보여줘”, “찾아줘”) differ in perceived task type and urgency. |\n| LING_has_past_reference     | binary     | queries     | 1 if refers to past events (e.g., “지난주”, “지난번”, “작년”, “갔던”, “먹었던”), else 0. | Past-oriented recall tasks often allow slightly more latency than imminent future tasks. |\n| LING_has_future_reference   | binary     | queries     | 1 if refers to future (e.g., “내일”), else 0. | Future/appointment-related queries are more time-critical, reducing acceptable latency. |\n| LING_has_modal              | binary     | queries     | 1 if contains modal-like expressions (e.g., “어디였지?”, “뭐였지?” as epistemic uncertainty), else 0. | Expressions of uncertainty can signal memory-aid tasks, where users may tolerate some delay. |\n| LING_has_negation           | binary     | queries     | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”) appears, else 0 (none here). | Negation increases syntactic complexity and cognitive load, potentially affecting MAL. |\n| LING_clause_complexity      | ordinal    | queries     | 1=simple, 2=one modifier/relative clause, 3=multiple clauses. | More clauses/embedded phrases increase parsing complexity and expected system effort. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio        | numeric    | queries     | Approx. count_verbs / count_nouns (heuristic by Korean endings vs content words). | Verb-heavy queries may encode more actions/operations; noun-heavy queries more entities, affecting task structure. |\n\n### C. SEMANTIC & DOMAIN FEATURES\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary          | categorical| queries     | Main domain: {media, finance, shopping, events, personal_photos, documents, music, location, schedule, other}. | Domain strongly shapes expectations about latency (e.g., finance and schedule often feel more time-critical). |\n| SEM_domain_secondary        | categorical| queries     | Secondary domain if present (e.g., {sports, travel, family, pet, none}). | Secondary themes refine context and may correlate with emotional salience and MAL. |\n| SEM_entity_person_count     | numeric    | queries     | Count of distinct person names (e.g., “소연이”, “지민이”, “지원이”). | Personal references increase emotional relevance and may reduce tolerance for delay. |\n| SEM_entity_time_count       | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit time expressions (e.g., “지난주”, “4월 1일”, “어제”, “내일”, “작년 겨울”). | More temporal anchors imply more specific retrieval, influencing perceived difficulty and latency expectations. |\n| SEM_entity_location_count   | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit locations/places (e.g., “골프장”, “산”, “공원”, “라이딩 코스”). | Location-based recall may involve larger search spaces (photos, maps), affecting MAL. |\n| SEM_entity_finance_flag     | binary     | queries     | 1 if financial terms present (e.g., “결제”, “5만원”, “카드”, “통장”, “계좌번호”, “체크카드”), else 0. | Financial queries are high-stakes; users often expect faster, more precise responses. |\n| SEM_abstractness_score      | ordinal    | queries     | 1–5 (1=very concrete like specific photo; 5=highly abstract). | More abstract queries allow fuzzier answers and may tolerate more latency; concrete ones feel more transactional. |\n| SEM_specificity_score       | ordinal    | queries     | 1–5 (1=very vague, 5=highly specific with multiple constraints). | High specificity implies narrow target and more complex matching, which users may expect to take longer. |\n| SEM_ambiguity_score         | ordinal    | queries     | 1–5 (1=unambiguous, 5=highly ambiguous). | Ambiguous queries increase cognitive and computational effort; users might accept more latency but also be more sensitive to delays. |\n\n### D. TASK & OPERATION COMPLEXITY\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count        | numeric    | queries     | Number of distinct operations (e.g., search, filter, aggregate, identify). | More operations imply higher system workload and user expectation of longer processing time. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering        | binary     | queries     | 1 if query includes temporal/semantic filters (e.g., “지난주에”, “여름에”, “4월 1일에”), else 0. | Filtering over personal data increases computational steps and perceived complexity. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation      | binary     | queries     | 1 if requires aggregation/summarization (e.g., “다 보여줘”, “어디에 쓴 거지?”), else 0. | Aggregation tasks (collect all, summarize spending) are more complex than single-item retrieval. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting          | binary     | queries     | 1 if implies ordering (e.g., “반복해서 들은 노래”, “가장 최근”), else 0 (here: repetition implies some ranking). | Sorting/ranking increases computational cost and may increase acceptable latency. |\n| TASK_modality_types         | categorical| queries     | {text_only, photo, video, audio, mixed}. | Multi-modal retrieval (photos, videos, music) typically requires heavier processing than text-only. |\n| TASK_external_dependency    | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=optional external app/service, 2=required (e.g., card records, streaming history). | External dependencies (bank, music app) add latency sources; users may anticipate this. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count  | ordinal    | queries     | 1=single item, 2=few items, 3=many items (“다 보여줘”, travel albums). | More results mean more search and rendering time, often increasing tolerated latency. |\n\n### E. TEMPORAL & CONTEXTUAL FEATURES\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type         | categorical| queries     | {absolute, relative, none}. Absolute: “4월 1일”, relative: “지난주”, “어제”, “내일”. | Temporal anchoring affects search scope and urgency (future vs past). |\n| TEMP_range_specificity      | ordinal    | queries     | 1=very broad (“작년 겨울”), 2=medium (“지난주”), 3=exact date/time (“4월 1일”, “몇 시에”). | Narrower time windows reduce search space but increase precision demands, impacting MAL. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement    | ordinal    | queries     | 1=historical (작년, 지난번 여행), 2=recent past (어제, 지난주), 3=imminent/future (내일). | Imminent/future tasks (appointments) are more time-critical, lowering acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need          | binary     | queries     | 1 if answer must reflect up-to-the-minute state (none here, so 0), else 0. | Real-time needs (traffic, stock) drastically reduce acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_location_context_need  | binary     | queries     | 1 if location context is central (e.g., “어디였지?”, “골프장 어디”), else 0. | Location-context tasks may involve maps/GPS history, increasing computational demand. |\n\n### F. USER INTENT & URGENCY\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level        | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5 (0=very low, 5=critical). Heuristic: schedule/finance/future meetups higher; memories/photos lower. | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency; users feel more time pressure. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5 (0=trivial, 5=severe if wrong/late). | High-consequence tasks (finance, official docs) demand faster, more reliable responses. |\n| INTENT_priority_indicator   | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3 (0=casual, 3=high priority). | Priority reflects user’s internal task hierarchy, shaping patience for delay. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone       | categorical| queries     | {neutral, nostalgic, planning, anxious_like}. | Emotional framing (nostalgic travel vs financial concern) changes tolerance for waiting. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality | ordinal| queries     | 0–3 (0=nice-to-have, 3=must-succeed). | When success is critical (e.g., card payment trace), users may be less tolerant of long waits. |\n\n### G. INFORMATION DENSITY\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| INFO_density_score          | numeric    | queries     | Approx. constraints per word (INFO_constraint_count / TXT_word_count). | Higher density means more information per word, increasing cognitive and computational load. |\n| INFO_constraint_count       | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit constraints (time, person, amount, modality, media type, etc.). | More constraints narrow the search but increase matching complexity, affecting MAL. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement  | ordinal    | queries     | 1–5 (1=rough answer ok, 5=exact item/amount/title required). | High precision demands (exact title, amount) reduce tolerance for approximate/slow responses. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement     | ordinal    | queries     | 1–5 (1=single highlight, 5=exhaustive “다 보여줘”). | High recall (all relevant items) implies larger search and longer acceptable latency. |\n\n### H. COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND INDICATORS\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size      | ordinal    | queries     | 1=small, 2=medium, 3=large, 4=massive (e.g., all photos, all transactions). | Larger search spaces naturally take longer; users may anticipate and accept more delay. |\n| COMP_index_complexity       | ordinal    | queries     | 1–3 (1=simple key lookup, 3=complex multi-field search). | Complex indexing (time+person+media type) increases system effort and expected latency. |\n| COMP_join_operations        | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3 (0=no join, 3=multiple data sources like photos+transactions+locations). | More joins across data sources (bank + calendar + media) increase latency. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth        | ordinal    | queries     | 1–3 (1=direct retrieval, 3=requires inference like “반복해서 들은 노래”). | Deeper reasoning (frequency analysis, pattern detection) increases processing time and tolerated MAL.

규칙 기반 값이며, 실제 구현 시에는 토크나이저/형태소 분석기를 사용해 정확히 계산하는 것이 좋습니다.)\n\n---\n\n4. **Modeling_Notes**\n\n- 이 피처들 중에서는 특히 `SEM_domain_primary/secondary`, `SEM_entity_finance_flag`, `TEMP_recency_requirement`, `INTENT_urgency_level`, `INTENT_consequence_severity`, `TASK_modality_types`, `COMP_search_space_size`, `INFO_constraint_count` 등이 MAL과 강하게 연관될 가능성이 큽니다.  \n- 모델로는 해석 가능성과 비선형 상호작용을 모두 고려해, 먼저 선형/Elastic Net, GAM(Generalized Additive Models)로 전반적 경향을 보고, 이후 Gradient Boosted Trees(XGBoost/LightGBM)나 Random Forest로 비선형·교호작용을 포착하는 것을 추천합니다.  \n- 데이터 규모가 커지면 도메인/의도 임베딩을 추가한 혼합 모델(트리 + 임베딩 기반 모델)도 고려할 수 있습니다. 평가에서는 K-fold 교차검증과 함께, 도메인별(예: finance vs photos vs schedule) stratified 평가를 수행해 특정 도메인 편향 없이 MAL을 잘 예측하는지 확인하는 것이 좋습니다.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\n이 피처들은 질의의 길이·구조(TXT, LING), 의미·도메인(SEM), 과업 복잡도(TASK), 시간·맥락(TEMP), 사용자 의도·긴급도(INTENT), 정보 밀도(INFO), 계산 요구량(COMP)을 다층적으로 포착합니다. 인지심리·HFE 관점에서, 사용자가 수행하려는 기억 회상, 일정 확인, 금융 내역 추적, 사진/영상 탐색 등은 각각 다른 정신적 모델과 기대 처리 시간을 동반하며, 이러한 차이가 MAL에 반영됩니다.\n\n예를 들어, `INTENT_urgency_level`과 `TEMP_recency_requirement`가 높은 일정/미래 약속 질의는 시간 압박이 커 MAL이 낮아지는 경향이 있고, `COMP_search_space_size`와 `TASK_expected_result_count`가 큰 여행 사진·쇼핑 후보 사진 질의는 “원래 오래 걸릴 것”이라는 기대 때문에 더 긴 지연을 허용할 수 있습니다. 또한 금융·여권·계좌번호처럼 `SEM_entity_finance_flag`와 `INTENT_consequence_severity`가 높은 질의는 결과의 정확성과 신속성이 모두 중요해, 짧은 지연에도 민감할 수 있습니다. 이런 피처 설계는 MAL 예측 모델이 단순 길이·도메인뿐 아니라, 사용자의 인지 부하, 긴급도, 신뢰 기대를 반영해 보다 인간 중심적으로 지연 허용도를 추정하도록 돕습니다."

(총 36개)\n\n### A. BASIC TEXT STATISTICS\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| TXT_char_count | numeric | queries | Number of characters including spaces. | Longer queries often encode more constraints and complexity, which can increase both computational effort and user tolerance for latency. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces | numeric | queries | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures actual symbol density; higher density can reflect more information to process. |\n| TXT_word_count | numeric | queries | Number of space-separated tokens. | More tokens typically mean more semantic content and potential sub-tasks, affecting perceived waiting time. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length | numeric | queries | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count. | Longer average word length can indicate more specific or technical content, which users may expect to take longer. |\n| TXT_sentence_count | numeric | queries | Count of sentences (here all are 1, but defined as number of “?”, “.”, “!” segments). | Multiple sentences usually indicate multi-step tasks, increasing complexity and acceptable latency. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count | numeric | queries | Count of punctuation marks (e.g., “?”, “,”, “.”). | Punctuation can signal structure and complexity (lists, conditions), influencing cognitive parsing effort. |\n| TXT_question_mark | binary | queries | 1 if “?” present, else 0. | Explicit questions frame the interaction as information retrieval, where users may expect faster responses. |\n| TXT_special_char_count | numeric | queries | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., “%”, “/” – here mostly 0). | Special characters often indicate numeric or technical constraints, which can increase computational work. |\n\n### B. LINGUISTIC & SYNTACTIC FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| LING_query_type | categorical | queries | {interrogative, imperative, declarative}; here all are “interrogative”. | Interrogatives typically demand direct answers, often with lower tolerated latency than open-ended tasks. |\n| LING_tense | categorical | queries | Dominant tense of the query: {past, present, future}. | Past-oriented recall vs present status vs future planning can change urgency and recency requirements. |\n| LING_has_modal | binary | queries | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., “should”, “must”) present; else 0 (all 0 here). | Modality often encodes obligation/necessity, which can heighten perceived urgency and lower MAL. |\n| LING_has_negation | binary | queries | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”) present; else 0. | Negation increases processing complexity and risk of misinterpretation, which may increase acceptable latency. |\n| LING_has_conditional | binary | queries | 1 if conditional structure (“면”, “다면”, “비교했을 때”) present. | Conditionals imply comparisons or scenario reasoning, increasing reasoning depth and latency tolerance. |\n| LING_clause_complexity | ordinal (1–3) | queries | 1=simple clause, 2=one subordinate/relative clause, 3=multiple clauses; here comparison phrases or embedded time clauses rated 2, others 1. | More clauses increase working-memory load and task complexity, often justifying longer waits. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio | numeric | queries | Approximate count of verbs / nouns using heuristic patterns (e.g., “했지”, “샀지” as verbs). | The balance of actions vs entities reflects whether the task is more procedural (actions) or referential (objects), affecting computation style and latency expectations. |\n\n### C. SEMANTIC & DOMAIN FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary | categorical | queries | Main domain: {shopping, finance, media, social, schedule, health_fitness, travel_leisure, food_dining, work_study, activity_tracking, comparison_progress, other}. | Different domains have different urgency norms (e.g., schedule vs retrospective stats), shaping MAL. |\n| SEM_domain_secondary | categorical | queries | Secondary domain if applicable (e.g., “shopping+finance” for spend queries), else “none”. | Mixed-domain tasks (e.g., finance+shopping) may be seen as more complex and important, affecting tolerance. |\n| SEM_entity_person | binary | queries | 1 if a person name or role (e.g., “부모님”, “친구”, “성훈이”) appears. | Personal social entities can increase emotional salience and sometimes urgency. |\n| SEM_entity_location | binary | queries | 1 if a place (e.g., “레스토랑”, “호텔”, “뉴욕”) appears. | Location-based recall often involves episodic memory; users may tolerate more latency for richer reconstruction. |\n| SEM_entity_time | binary | queries | 1 if explicit time expressions (e.g., “작년”, “지난달”, “오늘”, “이번 달”) appear. | Time anchoring is central to activity tracking; it also constrains search space and recency needs. |\n| SEM_entity_org | binary | queries | 1 if organization/brand (e.g., “쿠팡”, “이마트”, “유튜브”, “넷플릭스”) appears. | Organizational entities often imply structured logs or external APIs, increasing computational expectations. |\n| SEM_entity_count | numeric | queries | Approximate number of distinct named entities (persons, orgs, locations, explicit time spans). | More entities generally mean more constraints and joins over different data sources. |\n| SEM_abstractness | ordinal (0–10) | queries | 0=fully concrete (specific events/places), 10=highly abstract; activity counts ~4–6, comparisons ~6–7. | Abstract queries require more interpretation and aggregation, often increasing reasoning time and MAL. |\n| SEM_specificity | ordinal (0–10) | queries | 0=very vague, 10=very specific (e.g., “오늘 미팅 장소와 시간” ~9). | Highly specific queries narrow the search space but also raise expectations for accuracy and speed. |\n| SEM_ambiguity | ordinal (0–10) | queries | 0=unambiguous, 10=highly ambiguous; generic “운동” higher ambiguity than “수영”. | Ambiguous queries may require disambiguation or broader search, increasing cognitive and computational load. |\n\n### D. TASK & OPERATION COMPLEXITY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count | numeric | queries | Number of logical operations/subtasks (e.g., filter by time + aggregate count = 2). | More operations increase system work and user expectation that “complex tasks take longer”. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering | binary | queries | 1 if query requires filtering by time, place, category, etc. | Filtering over logs or history increases search operations and perceived complexity. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation | binary | queries | 1 if query asks for counts, totals, or sums (e.g., “몇 번”, “총 얼마나”). | Aggregations over time windows are computationally heavier and feel like “analytics”, where users accept more delay. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting | binary | queries | 1 if explicit or implicit ordering is required (e.g., “가장 많이”, not present here so 0). | Sorting adds extra computation and can increase acceptable latency for analytic tasks. |\n| TASK_modality_types | ordinal (1–3) | queries | 1=text-only recall, 2=text+structured logs, 3=text+multi-modal (e.g., photos, videos; none here so mostly 2 for logs, 1 for pure recall). | Multi-modal or structured-log tasks are perceived as heavier, increasing MAL. |\n| TASK_external_dependency | ordinal (0–2) | queries | 0=no external data, 1=optional external (e.g., local logs), 2=required external services/APIs (e.g., streaming platforms). | External dependencies introduce network/IO delays that users implicitly factor into acceptable waiting time. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count | ordinal (1–3) | queries | 1=single item (e.g., “어디였지?”), 2=few items, 3=many (e.g., “몇 번이나 있었지?” over a year). | Larger result sets take longer to compute and inspect, often increasing tolerated latency. |\n\n### E. TEMPORAL & CONTEXTUAL FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type | categorical | queries | {absolute, relative, none}; “작년”, “지난달”, “올해”, “이번 달” treated as relative; specific calendar-like spans as absolute. | Temporal framing affects recency expectations and size of the time window searched. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity | ordinal (1–3) | queries | 1=broad (“지난해”), 2=medium (“올해 상반기”, “이번 달”), 3=very narrow (“오늘”, “지난주”). | Narrow ranges reduce search space but often increase urgency and expectation of quick answers. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement | ordinal (0–5) | queries | 0=historical summary, 5=needs up-to-the-moment data; “오늘” or “이번 달” activity higher (3–4) than “작년”. | Higher recency needs correlate with lower acceptable latency, especially for monitoring tasks. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need | binary | queries | 1 if user likely expects near-real-time status (e.g., “오늘 … 장소와 시간”), else 0. | Real-time expectations strongly reduce MAL. |\n| TEMP_location_context | binary | queries | 1 if location context is central (e.g., “어디서”, “어디였지?”, “매장에서”), else 0. | Location-based recall may involve geo-logs; users may accept more latency for accurate reconstruction. |\n\n### F. USER INTENT & URGENCY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level | ordinal (0–5) | queries | 0=very low, 5=critical; schedule for “오늘” rated higher (3–4), retrospective stats lower (1–2). | Higher urgency typically lowers MAL; users are less tolerant of delays when immediate action is needed. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity | ordinal (0–5) | queries | 0=trivial curiosity, 5=severe impact; missing today’s meeting ~3–4, forgetting last year’s counts ~1–2. | Higher stakes reduce acceptable waiting time. |\n| INTENT_priority | ordinal (0–5) | queries | Perceived task priority in daily life; schedule > finance > activity stats > media. | Priority influences how much delay users are willing to accept before abandoning the task. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone | categorical | queries | {neutral, positive, negative, anxious, reflective}; most are “neutral” or “reflective” (e.g., past memories). | Emotional tone modulates time perception; anxious states make delays feel longer and less acceptable. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality | ordinal (0–5) | queries | Importance of getting a correct/complete answer for user satisfaction; schedule and finance higher (3–4), casual media stats lower (2). | When correctness is critical, users may accept slightly more latency for accuracy, up to a point. |\n\n### G. INFORMATION DENSITY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| INFO_density_score | ordinal (0–10) | queries | Heuristic score combining TXT_word_count and number of constraints; short but highly constrained queries (time+place) ~7–8. | Higher density means more information per word, increasing cognitive parsing and system reasoning. |\n| INFO_constraint_count | numeric | queries | Count of explicit constraints: time window, location, activity type, platform, comparison, etc. | More constraints narrow the search but increase logical complexity, affecting latency expectations. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement | ordinal (0–10) | queries | Required answer precision; exact time/place ~9–10, approximate counts ~6–7. | High precision demands more careful computation and verification, which users may allow more time for. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement | ordinal (0–10) | queries | Breadth/completeness needed; “지난해에 약속이 몇 번이나 있었지?” higher (~8) than a single-event recall (~4–5). | High recall tasks (covering long periods) are expected to take longer, increasing MAL. |\n\n### H. COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND INDICATORS\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size | ordinal (1–4) | queries | 1=small (single day/event), 2=medium (week/month), 3=large (half-year/year), 4=massive (multi-year). | Larger search spaces increase compute time and user expectation of delay. |\n| COMP_index_complexity | ordinal (1–3) | queries | 1=simple index (time only), 2=two dimensions (time+activity/platform), 3=multi-dimensional (time+activity+location+comparison). | More complex indexing (multi-key lookups) increases system complexity and perceived latency. |\n| COMP_join_operations | ordinal (0–3) | queries | 0=no joins, 1=single data source, 2=two sources (e.g., activity+location), 3=multiple sources (e.g., logs+payments+platform). | Joins across logs or services increase latency and user tolerance. |\n|

MAL에 가장 큰 영향을 줄 것으로 예상되는 것은 (1) TEMP_recency_requirement와 INTENT_urgency_level/INTENT_consequence_severity(실시간·오늘 일정 등), (2) TASK_needs_aggregation, COMP_search_space_size, COMP_reasoning_depth(분석·비교형 질의), (3) SEM_domain_primary/secondary(스케줄·재무 vs 취미·미디어)입니다.  \n\n모델로는 해석 가능성과 비선형 상호작용을 모두 고려해, 먼저 선형 회귀/Elastic Net으로 전반적 방향성을 보고, 이후 Gradient Boosted Trees(XGBoost, LightGBM)나 Random Forest로 비선형 효과를 포착하는 것을 권장합니다. 데이터가 늘어나면 도메인 임베딩을 추가한 간단한 신경망도 고려할 수 있습니다. 평가에서는 K-fold 교차검증(예: k=5)과 함께 MAE, RMSE를 사용하고, 도메인별/시간범위별로 stratified 분석을 수행해 특정 도메인에 편향되지 않는지 확인하는 것이 좋습니다.  \n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\n이 특징들은 인간공학·인지심리 관점에서 사용자가 “얼마나 기다릴 수 있는가”를 결정하는 핵심 요인을 구조화합니다. 텍스트·언어적 특징(TXT_, LING_)은 질의를 이해하는 데 필요한 인지 부하(문장 길이, 절 구조)를 반영하고, 의미·도메인 특징(SEM_)은 과업의 중요도와 맥락(일정, 재무, 건강 vs 취미)을 포착합니다. 과업·계산 복잡도(TASK_, COMP_)는 시스템이 실제로 수행해야 하는 연산량(필터링, 집계, 비교, 조인)을 근사하여, 사용자가 “이 정도 분석이면 좀 걸리겠지”라고 기대하는 시간을 모델링합니다.  \n\n시간·맥락(TEMP_)과 의도·긴급성(INTENT_)은 특히 MAL과 직접적으로 연결됩니다. 오늘 일정·실시간에 가까운 정보는 높은 긴급도와 결과 심각도를 가지므로 허용 지연이 낮고, 반대로 지난 해 활동 통계나 과거 추억 회상은 긴급도가 낮아 더 긴 지연도 수용됩니다. 정보 밀도와 제약(INFO_)는 질의가 얼마나 구체적이고 정밀한 답을 요구하는지를 나타내며, 이는 사용자가 “정확한 답을 위해서라면 약간 더 기다릴 의향”과 연결됩니다. 이런 다층적 특징 설계를 통해, 모델은 단순 길이나 도메인뿐 아니라 인지 부하·기대·신뢰·시간 압박을 함께 반영한 MAL 예측을 학습할 수 있습니다."

(총 36개)\n\n### A. BASIC TEXT STATISTICS\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| TXT_char_count | numeric | `queries` | Number of characters including spaces and punctuation. | Longer queries often encode more constraints and complexity, which can increase both computational work and user tolerance for latency. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces | numeric | `queries` | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures pure symbol density; higher density can reflect more compact, information-heavy queries. |\n| TXT_word_count | numeric | `queries` | Number of whitespace-separated tokens (Korean eojeol 기준). | More words usually mean more information and sub-intents, raising cognitive and computational load. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length | numeric | `queries` | `TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count`. | Longer average word length can indicate more technical or compound terms, often linked to higher processing complexity. |\n| TXT_sentence_count | numeric | `queries` | Count of sentences (here all queries are single-sentence → 1). | More sentences typically mean multi-step instructions; even if constant here, useful for generalization. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count | numeric | `queries` | Count of punctuation marks (e.g., `, . ? !`). | Punctuation often marks clauses and structure; more punctuation can signal more complex reasoning. |\n| TXT_question_mark | binary | `queries` | 1 if query contains `?`, else 0. | Explicit questions may set stronger expectations for prompt answers compared to pure commands. |\n| TXT_special_char_count | numeric | `queries` | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (here mostly same as punctuation). | Special characters can indicate lists, ranges, or structured input, affecting parsing complexity. |\n\n### B. LINGUISTIC & SYNTACTIC FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| LING_query_type | categorical | `queries` | {`interrogative`, `imperative`} based on endings like `?`, `알려줘`, `비교해줘`, `만들어줘`, `정리해줘`, `요약해줘`. | Interrogatives may feel like “information lookup” with lower tolerated latency; imperatives often imply “task execution” where users may accept more delay. |\n| LING_tense | categorical | `queries` | {`past`, `present`, `mixed`} based on time expressions (e.g., 어제/지난달/작년 vs 올해/이번 주). | Past-focused queries often allow more latency than real-time or present-focused tasks. |\n| LING_has_modality | binary | `queries` | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., `얼마나`, `가장`) appear, else 0. | Modality can signal comparative or optimization tasks, which are more complex and may justify longer waits. |\n| LING_has_negation | binary | `queries` | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., `않`, `안`) appears, else 0 (0 for all rows here). | Negation adds logical complexity and reasoning depth, often increasing processing time. |\n| LING_has_conditional | binary | `queries` | 1 if conditional markers like `면`, `다면` appear, else 0 (0 here). | Conditionals imply branching logic and scenario evaluation, raising computational and cognitive load. |\n| LING_clause_complexity | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1: simple clause; 2: one subordinate/relative clause; 3: multiple clauses. Here, queries with structures like `~했을 때 ~` or `A와 B 비교` set to 2, otherwise 1. | More clauses mean more relations to track, increasing mental workload and acceptable latency. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio | numeric | `queries` | Approximate ratio: (# of main verbs / # of content nouns), manually categorized: 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 depending on pattern. | Higher verb density suggests more actions per entity, indicating more operations and potential latency. |\n\n### C. SEMANTIC & DOMAIN FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary | categorical | `queries` | Main domain: {`finance`, `media`, `communication`, `shopping`, `work_study`, `health_fitness`, `lifestyle`, `other`}. | Domain affects typical data volume and user expectations (e.g., finance may tolerate more latency for accuracy). |\n| SEM_domain_secondary | categorical | `queries` | Secondary domain if present (e.g., `time`, `social`, `entertainment`), else `none`. | Cross-domain tasks (finance+time, social+communication) often require more joins and reasoning. |\n| SEM_entity_person | binary | `queries` | 1 if a person name or group (e.g., `성진`, `친구들`, `가족들`, `팀원들`, `동료들`) appears. | Person-centric queries may feel more personal/urgent, lowering acceptable latency. |\n| SEM_entity_time | binary | `queries` | 1 if explicit time expressions (어제, 이번 주, 지난달, 작년, 올해, 이번 달, 평일, 주말, 이맘때쯤) appear. | Time anchoring often implies temporal filtering and sometimes recency expectations. |\n| SEM_entity_location_org | binary | `queries` | 1 if place/organization (e.g., `마트`, `다이소`, `올리브영`, `편의점`) appears. | Location/organization entities can increase filter complexity and search space. |\n| SEM_entity_count | numeric | `queries` | Count of distinct named entities (persons, time periods, organizations, categories like `음악`, `게임`). Coarse manual count (1–3). | More entities usually mean more joins or groupings, increasing processing and tolerated latency. |\n| SEM_abstractness | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 0=fully concrete (e.g., specific payments), 10=highly abstract; here most are concrete (2–4), summaries ~5. | Abstract tasks (e.g., summarization) require more inference, often increasing acceptable wait. |\n| SEM_specificity | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Higher when query targets a narrow, well-defined set (e.g., `이번 주 요일 별 칼로리` ~8–9; broad summaries ~5–6). | High specificity implies clear success criteria and often smaller search space but higher precision expectations. |\n| SEM_ambiguity | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Subjective ambiguity of what counts as a correct answer (e.g., “가장 많이 들었던 음악” low ambiguity ~3; “대화 내용을 요약” higher ~6). | Ambiguous tasks may tolerate more latency because users expect interpretation and reasoning. |\n\n### D. TASK & OPERATION COMPLEXITY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count | numeric | `queries` | Estimated number of logical operations (filtering, grouping, comparing, summarizing). Range 1–4. | More operations directly increase computational steps and perceived task complexity. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering | binary | `queries` | 1 if query implies filtering by time, person, place, or category. | Filtering over logs/transactions increases I/O and index usage, affecting latency. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation | binary | `queries` | 1 if query asks for counts, sums, averages, or “얼마나 늘었지”. | Aggregations over many records are more expensive and users may expect some delay. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting | binary | `queries` | 1 if query requests ordering/ranking (e.g., `순서대로`, `가장 많이`). | Sorting large result sets is computationally heavier and may increase acceptable latency. |\n| TASK_needs_comparison | binary | `queries` | 1 if explicit comparison between periods/entities (e.g., `비교해줘`, `평소보다`). | Comparisons require computing metrics for multiple subsets, raising complexity. |\n| TASK_modality_types | numeric | `queries` | Count of modalities involved: 1=text-only; 2=text+image (for “찍어둔 것” implying photos). Here shopping-list-from-photos set to 2, others 1. | Multi-modal processing (image+text) is slower and users typically accept longer waits. |\n| TASK_external_dependency | ordinal (0–2) | `queries` | 0: self-contained; 1: depends on local logs; 2: depends on external services/APIs. Here all assumed 1 (personal data logs). | External or large-log dependencies increase latency variability and user expectations. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1: single value (e.g., “얼마나 늘었지”); 2: short list; 3: long list or full log/summary. | Longer outputs take more time to generate and read, often increasing acceptable latency. |\n\n### E. TEMPORAL & CONTEXTUAL FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type | categorical | `queries` | {`absolute`, `relative`, `none`}; all here are `relative` (어제, 이번 주, 지난달, 작년, 올해, 평일/주말). | Relative time references often map to sliding windows over logs, affecting query cost. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1: vague (이맘때쯤), 2: medium (이번 주, 이번 달), 3: precise (어제, 날짜 별, 시간 별). | More specific ranges narrow data but may increase grouping granularity (e.g., per-hour). |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | Higher when query is about very recent periods (어제/이번 주/이번 달: 4–5; 작년: 2–3). | High recency implies expectation of up-to-date data and lower tolerance for delay. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need | binary | `queries` | 1 if near-real-time monitoring implied; here all 0 (historical logs). | Real-time tasks strongly constrain acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_location_context | binary | `queries` | 1 if physical context like 집/밖, 여행, 마트/편의점 appears. | Contextualized tasks may involve additional filters and logs (e.g., GPS), increasing complexity. |\n\n### F. USER INTENT & URGENCY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | Subjective urgency: routine analytics (2–3), planning-related (3–4), no critical emergencies (0–1 unused here). | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency; users want faster responses. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | Perceived consequence of delay/error: finance/health planning (3–4), entertainment (1–2). | Higher stakes justify waiting longer for accuracy but also increase impatience; MAL may be non-linear. |\n| INTENT_priority | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | How central the task is to user goals: work/study summaries (4), financial logs (3–4), entertainment stats (2). | High-priority tasks may tolerate more latency if value is high, but also create time pressure. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone | categorical | `queries` | {`neutral`, `curious`, `planning`} inferred from wording; comparisons/“얼마나 늘었지” as `curious`, shopping/summary as `planning`. | Tone relates to time perception; curious/exploratory tasks often allow slightly more waiting than urgent corrective tasks. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | How critical it is that the answer feels complete/correct: summaries and financial overviews (4), simple comparisons (3), entertainment stats (2). | High criticality may increase tolerated latency in exchange for thoroughness. |\n\n### G. INFORMATION DENSITY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| INFO_density_score | numeric (0–10) | `queries` | Heuristic: proportional to `TXT_word_count` and number of constraints; simple single-focus queries ~4–5, multi-constraint summaries ~7–8. | Higher density means more bits per word, increasing processing and acceptable latency. |\n| INFO_constraint_count | numeric | `queries` | Count of explicit constraints (time window, person, channel, category, modality). Range 1–4. | More constraints narrow the search but increase query parsing and planning complexity. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Required answer exactness: numeric comparisons and “얼마나 늘었지” ~8–9; qualitative summaries ~6–7. | High precision demands more careful computation and verification, which users may accept slower. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Need to cover all relevant items: “리스트 만들어줘”, “내역을 정리해서” ~8–9; simple comparisons ~5–6. | High recall tasks (complete logs/lists) are heavier and users expect longer runtimes. |\n\n### H. COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND INDICATORS\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size | ordinal (1–4) | `queries` | 1: very small (single person/short time); 2: small; 3: large (month of logs); 4: massive (all-time). | Larger search spaces increase latency and can normalize longer waits. |\n| COMP_index_complexity | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1: single key (time); 2: two keys (time+category/person); 3: multi-key (time+category+modality). | More complex indexing and joins raise computational cost. |\n| COMP_join_operations | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 0: single table; 1: 2 logical sources; 2: 3+ sources (e.g., time+person+channel); here comparisons and multi-entity tasks often 1–2. | Joins are expensive; more joins → more latency. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1: direct retrieval; 2: simple aggregation/comparison; 3: summarization or multi-step reasoning. | Deeper reasoning (e.g., text summarization) is slower and users usually accept more delay. |\n\n---\n\n3. **Expanded_Dataset_CSV**\n\n아래 CSV는 원본 열(`queries`, `MAL`)에 위 피처들을 수동 규칙에 따라 일관되게 부여한 예시입니다.

이 피처셋에서 MAL과 가장 강하게 연관될 것으로 기대되는 것은 과업·계산 복잡도 관련 피처들입니다: `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_needs_aggregation`, `TASK_needs_sorting`, `TASK_expected_result_count`, `COMP_search_space_size`, `COMP_reasoning_depth` 등. 또한 시간·의도 관련 피처(`TEMP_recency_requirement`, `INTENT_urgency_level`, `INTENT_consequence_severity`)는 허용 지연시간의 상·하한을 설명하는 데 중요할 수 있습니다.\n- 추천 모델 패밀리는 해석 가능성과 비선형성을 모두 고려해, 우선 선형/Elastic Net 회귀로 전반적 경향과 피처 중요도를 보고, 이후 Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost/LightGBM)나 Random Forest로 상호작용과 비선형 효과를 포착하는 접근입니다. 데이터가 더 커진다면 GAM(Generalized Additive Models)도 HF/E 해석에 적합합니다.\n- 평가 방식으로는 K-fold 교차검증(예: k=5)을 사용하고, 회귀 지표(MAE, RMSE, R²)를 함께 보고, 특히 MAE를 사용자 체감 오차로 해석하는 것이 좋습니다. 도메인별(재무, 건강, 커뮤니케이션 등) 서브셋 성능을 따로 보는 것도 유용합니다.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\n이 피처들은 인간공학·인지심리 관점에서 사용자가 “얼마나 기다릴 의향이 있는지”를 설명하는 요인들을 구조화합니다. 텍스트 길이와 정보 밀도(`TXT_*`, `INFO_*`)는 질의에 담긴 정보량과 제약 수를 반영해 인지 부하와 계산량을 동시에 나타냅니다. 언어·의미 피처(`LING_*`, `SEM_*`)는 질의가 단순 조회인지, 비교·추론·요약인지, 어떤 도메인과 엔티티를 포함하는지 드러내어, 작업 복잡도와 기대 정확도 수준을 설명합니다.\n\n과업·계산 피처(`TASK_*`, `COMP_*`)는 필터링, 집계, 정렬, 조인, 요약 등 실제 시스템이 수행해야 할 연산 단계를 모델링하여, 시스템 지연의 “객관적” 원인을 포착합니다. 시간·맥락(`TEMP_*`)과 의도·긴급성(`INTENT_*`) 피처는 사용자가 상황적으로 느끼는 시간 압박, 중요도, 결과의 완전성 요구를 반영해, 동일한 계산량이라도 어떤 상황에서는 더 짧은 MAL이, 다른 상황에서는 더 긴 MAL이 허용되는 이유를 설명합니다. 이처럼 다층적인 피처 설계는 인지 부하, 긴급성, 신뢰·기대 수준이 어떻게 결합되어 “수용 가능한 대기시간”이라는 행동적 결과(MAL)로 나타나는지를 정량적으로 학습할 수 있게 해 줍니다."

MAL 자체는 예측하지 않고, MAL과 이론적으로 연관될 수 있는 인지 부하, 긴급성, 정보 밀도, 계산 요구도를 반영하는 특징들을 설계하는 것이 핵심입니다.\n\n---\n\n2. **Feature_Specification**\n\n아래 표는 설계된 특징들을 카테고리별로 정리한 것입니다. (총 36개)\n\n### A. BASIC TEXT STATISTICS\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| TXT_char_count | numeric | `queries` | 전체 문자열 길이(문자 수, 공백 포함). | 길이가 길수록 정보량과 잠재적 과업 복잡도가 증가해, 사용자는 더 긴 처리 시간을 허용할 수 있음. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces | numeric | `queries` | 공백을 제거한 후의 문자 수. | 실제 내용 밀도를 더 잘 반영하며, 인지적으로 처리해야 할 단위 수와 관련. |\n| TXT_word_count | numeric | `queries` | 공백 기준 토큰 개수(한국어에서도 공백 단위로 근사). | 단어 수가 많을수록 이해·계획에 필요한 인지 부하가 커져, 약간 더 긴 지연을 수용할 가능성이 있음. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length | numeric | `queries` | `TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count`. | 평균 단어 길이는 전문성/복잡성의 지표로, 더 긴 단어는 추상적·전문적 내용을 암시해 처리 복잡도와 MAL 허용도에 영향. |\n| TXT_sentence_count | numeric | `queries` | 마침표/물음표/느낌표/줄바꿈 기준 문장 수(여기서는 모두 1로 고정). | 문장 수가 많으면 다단계 과업일 가능성이 커져, 사용자는 더 긴 응답 시간을 기대할 수 있음. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count | numeric | `queries` | 구두점(, . ? ! ' \" 등) 개수. | 구두점은 구조화·인용·조건 등을 나타내며, 문장 구조 복잡도와 관련. |\n| TXT_special_char_count | numeric | `queries` | 한글/영문/숫자/공백을 제외한 특수문자 수(예: 따옴표, 콜론). | 특수문자는 인용, 제목, 형식화된 엔티티를 나타내며, 검색/매칭 복잡도와 연관. |\n| TXT_text_density | numeric | `queries` | `TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_sentence_count`. | 문장당 정보량(문자 수)으로, 정보 밀도와 인지 부하를 근사. |\n\n### B. LINGUISTIC & SYNTACTIC FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| LING_query_type | categorical | `queries` | 문장 유형: 대부분 “~해줘/추천해줘/찾아줘/알려줘/만들어줘” → `imperative`. | 명령형은 시스템에 대한 기대가 명확하며, 사용자는 도구적 목표 달성에 초점을 두어 MAL에 대한 허용 범위가 과업 특성에 의해 좌우됨. |\n| LING_tense | categorical | `queries` | 주된 시간 시제: `past`(지난달, 지난 주말 등), `present`(지금, 오늘), `none`(일반적 추천). | 과거/현재 지향 여부는 실시간성 요구와 연결되어, 현재 지향일수록 짧은 MAL을 기대하는 경향. |\n| LING_has_modality | binary | `queries` | “수 있는, 할 수 있는, 갈 만한” 등 가능성/능력을 나타내는 표현 포함 여부. | 가능성/제약 표현은 조건 탐색·필터링을 내포해 과업 복잡도와 계산 요구를 증가시킬 수 있음. |\n| LING_has_negation | binary | `queries` | “안, 못, 아니다” 등 부정 표현 포함 여부(본 데이터에서는 0). | 부정은 조건 공간을 비선형적으로 만들며, 이해·계산 복잡도를 증가시켜 MAL 허용도에 영향. |\n| LING_has_conditional | binary | `queries` | “면, 경우, 때” 등 조건절 포함 여부(여기서는 0으로 근사). | 조건절은 분기된 시나리오를 의미해, 시스템의 추론·필터링 부담과 사용자의 기대 처리량을 높임. |\n| LING_clause_complexity | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 절/구조 복잡도: 단순 명령=1, 수식어/관형절 1개=2, 2개 이상=3. (예: “만보 정도 걸을 수 있는 한강 산책 코스 추천해줘” → 2). | 절이 많을수록 해석해야 할 제약과 관계가 늘어나 인지 부하와 계산 요구가 증가. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio | numeric | `queries` | 동사/용언(“추천해줘, 찾아줘, 정리해줘, 만들어줘”) 수를 명사/체언 수로 나눈 비율(간단한 휴리스틱으로 근사). | 동사 대비 명사 비율은 행위 중심 vs 객체 중심 질의를 나타내며, 절차적 계획 vs 검색 중심 과업의 차이가 MAL에 영향을 줄 수 있음. |\n\n### C. SEMANTIC & DOMAIN FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary | categorical | `queries` | 주요 도메인: `summary`, `travel`, `photo_video`, `fitness`, `food_drink`, `shopping`, `media`, `finance_card`, `info_linkage` 등으로 수작업 분류. | 도메인별로 사용자의 기대 응답 시간과 시스템 처리 복잡도가 다르므로 MAL 예측에 핵심. |\n| SEM_domain_secondary | categorical | `queries` | 보조 도메인(예: `family`, `pet`, `work`, `study`, `entertainment`, `health` 등) 또는 `none`. | 맥락(가족, 업무, 건강 등)은 결과 중요도·정확도 기대를 바꾸어 MAL 허용도에 영향. |\n| SEM_entity_person_count | numeric | `queries` | 사람 관련 엔티티(가족, 친구, 반려동물, 두산이 등) 개수. | 사람/사회적 맥락이 많을수록 정서적 중요도가 높아질 수 있어, 사용자는 더 신중한 결과를 원하고 약간의 지연을 허용할 수 있음. |\n| SEM_entity_location_count | numeric | `queries` | 장소/지역(한강, 공원, 해변, 캠핑장, 집 근처, 아울렛, 백화점 등) 엔티티 개수. | 장소 제약이 많을수록 검색 공간이 구조화되지만, 위치 기반 필터링이 필요해 계산 요구와 MAL에 영향. |\n| SEM_entity_time_count | numeric | `queries` | 시간 표현(지난달, 지난 주말, 오늘, 지금, 여름휴가 등) 개수. | 시간 제약은 데이터 필터링과 신선도 요구를 의미하며, 실시간성 기대와 MAL 허용도에 직접 관련. |\n| SEM_entity_media_count | numeric | `queries` | 미디어/콘텐츠 엔티티(사진, 영상, 노트, 논문, 회의록, 메모, 영화, 드라마, 책, 유튜브 등) 개수. | 미디어 객체가 많을수록 멀티모달 처리·검색이 필요해 계산 비용과 허용 지연이 증가. |\n| SEM_abstractness | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 추상적 개념(느낌, 관련된 내용 등) 비중을 0–10 스케일로 수작업 평가. | 추상적일수록 해석·매핑이 어려워 추론 깊이와 계산 부담이 커지고, 사용자는 “생각이 필요함”을 인지해 더 긴 MAL을 허용할 수 있음. |\n| SEM_specificity | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 대상/조건의 구체성(가격, 거리, 장소명, 미디어 제목 등)을 0–10으로 평가. | 구체성이 높을수록 필터링이 쉬워 빠른 응답을 기대하지만, 동시에 정밀한 매칭을 요구해 허용 MAL이 도메인에 따라 달라짐. |\n| SEM_ambiguity | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 해석 모호성(“비슷한 느낌”, “이런” 등) 정도를 0–10으로 평가. | 모호성이 높으면 탐색·추천이 필요해 계산량과 인지적 협상(결과 탐색)이 늘어나, 사용자는 더 긴 지연을 수용할 수 있음. |\n\n### D. TASK & OPERATION COMPLEXITY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count | numeric | `queries` | 질의가 요구하는 주요 연산 수(검색, 필터링, 요약, 집계, 생성 등) 수작업 추정(1–3). | 연산 수가 많을수록 시스템 처리 파이프라인이 길어지고, 사용자는 더 긴 처리 시간을 예상. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering | binary | `queries` | 가격, 거리, 대상 타입(가족, 반려동물 등), 위치, 시간 등으로 필터링이 필요한 경우 1. | 필터링은 조건 처리와 인덱스 활용을 요구해 계산 복잡도와 MAL에 영향. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation | binary | `queries` | “모두 정리해줘, 한 장으로 요약, 모두 모아서” 등 집계/요약이 필요한 경우 1. | 집계·요약은 다수 항목을 통합하는 고부하 연산으로, 사용자는 자연스럽게 더 긴 지연을 허용. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting | binary | `queries` | 명시적 정렬(“추천 순, 가까운 순” 등)이 필요한 경우 1 (본 데이터에서는 대부분 0, 일부는 암묵적 0). | 정렬은 결과 후처리 비용을 의미하며, 대규모 결과 집합에서 MAL에 영향. |\n| TASK_modality_types | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 요구되는 모달리티 수: 텍스트=1, 텍스트+이미지=2, 텍스트+이미지+영상=3 등. | 모달리티가 많을수록 파이프라인이 복잡해지고, 사용자는 더 긴 처리 시간을 예상·허용. |\n| TASK_external_dependency | ordinal (0–2) | `queries` | 외부 서비스/데이터 필요도: 0=내부 데이터로 충분, 1=외부가 있으면 좋음, 2=외부 필수(지도, 상점 정보, 유튜브 등). | 외부 의존성이 높을수록 네트워크/서비스 지연이 포함되어 MAL이 커질 수 있고, 사용자는 이를 어느 정도 예상. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count | categorical | `queries` | 예상 결과 개수: `single`(1개), `few`(몇 개 추천), `many`(모두 모아서/정리). | 결과 개수가 많을수록 처리·표시 시간이 증가해 허용 MAL이 커질 수 있음. |\n\n### E. TEMPORAL & CONTEXTUAL FEATURES\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type | categorical | `queries` | 시간 참조 유형: `absolute`(지난달, 지난 주말, 오늘), `relative`(여름휴가 동안, 지난번), `none`. | 시간 참조는 데이터 필터링과 신선도 요구를 의미하며, 특히 `오늘/지금`은 짧은 MAL 기대와 연결. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 시간 범위 구체성: 없음=0, 넓은 기간(여름휴가)=1, 중간(지난달)=2, 짧은(오늘, 지난 주말)=3. | 범위가 좁을수록 필터링은 쉬우나 실시간성 기대가 커져 MAL 허용도가 낮아질 수 있음. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 최신성 요구: 과거 기록 요약=1, 일반 추천=1–2, “지금/오늘” 기반 추천=3. | 실시간성 요구가 높을수록 사용자는 짧은 응답을 기대해 MAL이 낮아지는 경향. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need | binary | `queries` | “지금, 오늘, 오늘같은 날씨, 지금 여기” 등 실시간 맥락이 있으면 1. | 실시간 맥락은 즉시성 기대를 강화해 허용 지연을 크게 줄임. |\n| TEMP_location_context | binary | `queries` | “집 근처, 여기, 한강, 공원, 캠핑장” 등 위치 맥락이 명시되면 1. | 위치 기반 과업은 맵/POI 검색 등 외부 연동을 수반해 계산·네트워크 지연과 MAL에 영향. |\n\n### F. USER INTENT & URGENCY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | “지금, 오늘, 목표 달성” 등 즉시성 표현을 기준으로 0–5 스케일 수작업 평가. | 긴급성이 높을수록 사용자는 짧은 지연만 허용하며, MAL이 낮아지는 주요 요인. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | 실패 시 결과 심각도(건강/재정/업무>여가)를 0–5로 평가. | 심각도가 높을수록 정확성·신뢰성 요구가 커져, 사용자는 더 신중한 처리를 기대하며 약간 더 긴 MAL을 허용할 수 있음. |\n| INTENT_priority | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | 사용자가 암묵적으로 부여한 우선순위(목표 달성, 오늘 해야 할 일 등)를 0–5로 평가. | 우선순위가 높을수록 사용자는 시스템 응답을 더 중요하게 여기며, 지연에 민감해질 수 있음. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone | categorical | `queries` | 정서 톤: 대부분 `neutral`, 일부 `goal_oriented` (목표 달성, 추천). | 정서 톤은 인지적 긴장과 시간 압박 인식을 조절해 MAL 허용도에 영향. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | 결과 만족도가 과업 전체 성공에 얼마나 중요한지 0–5로 평가(여행/추억/재정/건강>일반 추천). | 만족도 중요도가 높을수록 사용자는 더 나은 품질을 위해 약간의 추가 지연을 허용할 수 있음. |\n\n### G. INFORMATION DENSITY\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| INFO_density_score | ordinal (0–10) | `queries`, text stats | 질의 내 정보량(조건 수, 길이, 수식어 등)을 0–10으로 수작업 평가. | 정보 밀도가 높을수록 인지·계산 부하가 커져 MAL 허용도 증가 가능. |\n| INFO_constraint_count | numeric | `queries` | 명시적 제약(가격, 거리, 대상, 시간, 장소, 미디어 타입 등) 개수. | 제약이 많을수록 필터링·탐색이 복잡해져 처리 시간과 MAL에 영향. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 답변의 정밀도 요구(“비슷한 느낌”, “한 장으로 요약”, “10만원 정도” 등)를 0–10으로 평가. | 정밀도가 높을수록 사용자는 더 정확한 계산·검색을 기대해 약간 더 긴 MAL을 허용할 수 있음. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 전체를 빠짐없이 모아야 하는 정도(“모두 정리, 모두 모아서, 관련된 자료”)를 0–10으로 평가. | 높은 재현율 요구는 누락 방지를 위해 더 넓은 탐색·집계를 필요로 하며, MAL 증가와 연관. |\n\n### H. COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND INDICATORS\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size | ordinal (1–4) | `queries` | 탐색 공간 크기 추정: 1=작음(내 사진 중 일부), 2=중간(근처 상점), 3=큼(웹/콘텐츠 추천), 4=매우 큼(유튜브/뉴스 전역). | 탐색 공간이 클수록 시스템 계산 시간과 변동성이 커져 MAL이 증가할 수 있음. |\n| COMP_index_complexity | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 필요한 인덱스/피처 수(텍스트+이미지+메타데이터 등)를 0–3으로 평가. | 인덱스가 복잡할수록 쿼리 계획과 실행 비용이 커져 지연과 MAL에 영향. |\n| COMP_join_operations | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 서로 다른 데이터 소스(사진+지도, 노트+유튜브 등)를 조인해야 하는 정도를 0–3으로 평가. | 조인 연산은 I/O와 네트워크를 증가시켜 응답 지연과 허용 MAL을 키울 수 있음. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 단순 검색=0–1, 유사도/느낌 기반 추천=2, 다단계 추론/요약=3. | 추론 깊이가 깊을수록 모델 계산량과 불확실성이 커져, 사용자는 “생각하는 시간”을 더 허용할 수 있음. |\n\n---\n\n3. **Expanded_Dataset_CSV**\n\n아래는 원본 데이터에 위 특징들을 수작업 규칙에 따라 부여한 예시 CSV입니다.  \n(한국어 질의 특성상 일부 수치는 휴리스틱/수작업 레이블링이며, 실제 구현 시에는 규칙 기반/모델 기반

**Modeling_Notes**\n\n- 이 특징들 중에서는 특히 `SEM_domain_primary/secondary`, `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_modality_types`, `TASK_external_dependency`, `TEMP_realtime_need`, `INTENT_urgency_level`, `INFO_constraint_count`, `COMP_reasoning_depth` 등이 MAL과 강하게 연관될 가능성이 큽니다. 예를 들어, 실시간·위치 기반·목표 달성형 피트니스/결제 질의는 짧은 MAL, 대량 사진/영상 집계·요약 과업은 긴 MAL과 연관될 수 있습니다.\n- 모델링 관점에서는 해석 가능성과 비선형 관계를 모두 고려하기 위해, (1) 선형/Elastic Net 회귀로 1차 해석을 하고, (2) Gradient Boosted Trees(XGBoost/LightGBM)나 Random Forest로 비선형·상호작용을 포착하는 것을 추천합니다. 데이터가 더 많아지면 도메인 임베딩(예: BERT 기반 문장 임베딩)을 추가 피처로 결합할 수도 있습니다.\n- 평가에서는 K-fold 교차검증(예: 5-fold)을 사용하고, 회귀 지표로 MAE, RMSE, R²를 함께 모니터링하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 MAL은 절대 오차(초 단위 차이)가 사용자 경험에 직접 연결되므로 MAE를 주요 지표로 두고, 도메인별(여행/쇼핑/피트니스 등) 에러 분석을 병행하는 것이 바람직합니다.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\n이 특징들은 인간공학·인지심리 관점에서 사용자가 “얼마나 기다릴 의향이 있는가”를 결정하는 요인을 구조화한 것입니다. 텍스트 길이, 정보 밀도, 절 복잡도, 도메인, 제약 수, 모달리티 수, 추론 깊이 등은 과업의 인지 부하와 시스템 계산 부하를 동시에 반영합니다. 사용자는 복잡하고 ‘머리를 써야 할 것 같은’ 요약·집계·유사도 추천 과업에 대해서는 더 긴 처리 시간을 자연스럽게 허용하는 반면, “지금/오늘/여기”와 같이 실시간성이 강조된 과업에서는 짧은 지연만을 허용합니다.\n\n또한, `INTENT_urgency_level`, `TEMP_realtime_need`, `SEM_domain_primary`(예: 결제/건강 vs 여가/엔터테인먼트), `INTENT_satisfaction_criticality`는 시간 압박, 결과 중요도, 신뢰 기대를 반영해 MAL에 직접적인 영향을 줍니다. 예를 들어, “지금 여기 아울렛에서 할인되는 카드 추천해줘”는 즉시성·금전적 결과가 결합되어 매우 낮은 MAL을 요구하는 반면, “가족 단체 사진만 모두 모아서 영상으로 만들어줘”는 정서적으로 중요하지만 ‘공들인 결과’를 기대하기 때문에 비교적 긴 MAL도 허용될 수 있습니다. 이런 다차원적 특징 설계를 통해, 모델은 단순 길이·도메인 이상의 풍부한 인지·맥락 정보를 활용해 보다 사람-중심적인 MAL 예측을 학습할 수 있습니다."

**기대와 신뢰**를 간접적으로 수치화하기 위해 설계되었습니다. 예를 들어, 개인화 분석과 선물 추천처럼 `COMP_reasoning_depth`와 `INTENT_satisfaction_criticality`가 높은 과업은 사용자가 “생각 좀 해줘도 된다”고 느끼기 때문에 MAL이 상대적으로 크고, 반대로 `TEMP_recency_requirement`와 `TEMP_realtime_need`가 높은 현재 위치 기반·날씨·최신 뉴스 질의는 짧은 지연에도 민감합니다.\n\n또한 `INFO_constraint_count`, `SEM_specificity`, `TASK_needs_filtering` 등은 질의가 요구하는 조건과 필터의 수를 반영해 **정보 처리량과 계산 복잡도**를 나타냅니다. 이런 피처들은 사용자가 “조건이 많으니 좀 걸리겠지”라고 예상하는 정도를 모델이 학습하게 해 줍니다. 전반적으로, 이 피처 세트는 텍스트의 표면적 길이뿐 아니라 의미, 과업 구조, 시간·위치 맥락, 감정·의도까지 다층적으로 반영하여, MAL을 보다 안정적으로 예측할 수 있는 기반을 제공합니다."

    "batch": 6,
    "rows": "250-255",
    "response": "1. **Problem_Understanding**  \nThe dataset contains Korean natural-language queries and their measured Maximum Acceptable Latency (MAL, in seconds). The goal is to design and compute a rich set of interpretable features for each query that can later be used to model/predict MAL. Features span text statistics, linguistic structure, semantics, task complexity, temporal/contextual aspects, user intent/urgency, information density, and computational demand.\n\n---\n\n2. **Feature_Specification**\n\nBelow, features are grouped by category. Scales and encodings are fixed and applied consistently across all rows.\n\n### A. BASIC TEXT STATISTICS\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| TXT_char_count              | numeric    | queries     | Total number of characters including spaces. | Longer queries often indicate more complex tasks, which users may tolerate slightly longer latency for. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces    | numeric    | queries     | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures content density independent of spacing; more content can imply higher cognitive and computational load. |\n| TXT_word_count              | numeric    | queries     | Number of space-separated tokens (Korean eojeols). | More tokens usually mean more information and constraints, affecting both processing time and perceived acceptable wait. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length         | numeric    | queries     | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count. | Longer average word length can reflect more specific or technical content, potentially increasing processing complexity. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count       | numeric    | queries     | Count of punctuation characters (e.g., , . ? ! ()). | Punctuation often signals clause boundaries and structural complexity, which can increase parsing and reasoning demands. |\n| TXT_special_char_count      | numeric    | queries     | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., parentheses). | Special characters often denote references (e.g., “(캘린더)”) to external systems, hinting at integration complexity. |\n| TXT_contains_parentheses    | binary     | queries     | 1 if query contains “(” or “)”, else 0. | Parentheses often mark metadata or system names, which may require external lookups and thus higher latency tolerance. |\n| TXT_text_density            | numeric    | queries     | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / (TXT_word_count + 1). | A simple density proxy; denser text can indicate compact, information-rich queries, affecting cognitive load and MAL. |\n\n### B. LINGUISTIC & SYNTACTIC FEATURES\n\n(Heuristics tailored to these Korean queries.)\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| LING_query_type             | categorical| queries     | “imperative” if ends with “해줘/추천해줘”, else “other”. | Imperatives are direct requests; users may expect more “service-like” behavior and have clearer latency expectations. |\n| LING_has_modal              | binary     | queries     | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., “갈만한”) appear, else 0. | Modality can indicate evaluation or possibility, often implying more nuanced reasoning. |\n| LING_has_conditional        | binary     | queries     | 1 if explicit conditional markers (e.g., “면”, “다면”) appear, else 0. | Conditionals increase logical structure complexity, which can increase computational and cognitive load. |\n| LING_has_negation           | binary     | queries     | 1 if negation markers (e.g., “안”, “못”, “않”) appear, else 0. | Negation complicates interpretation and filtering, potentially increasing processing time and affecting MAL. |\n| LING_clause_count           | numeric    | queries     | Approximate number of clauses; here, 1 for simple single-predicate requests. | More clauses generally mean more sub-intents and higher complexity, which can increase acceptable latency. |\n| LING_verb_count             | numeric    | queries     | Count of main action verbs (e.g., “추천해줘”). | More verbs often mean more actions/subtasks, increasing task complexity and processing. |\n| LING_noun_count             | numeric    | queries     | Count of major content nouns (manual heuristic per query). | More nouns indicate more entities/constraints, increasing information to process. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio        | numeric    | queries     | LING_verb_count / (LING_noun_count + 1e-6). | Captures balance between actions and entities; different ratios may map to different interaction patterns and MAL. |\n\n### C. SEMANTIC & DOMAIN FEATURES\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary          | categorical| queries     | Main domain: one of {“dating”, “food_nutrition”, “schedule_planning”}. | Domain affects urgency and expectations (e.g., health vs casual dating) and typical computational pipelines. |\n| SEM_domain_secondary        | categorical| queries     | Secondary domain: e.g., “restaurant_search”, “health_data”, “calendar_integration”. | Captures finer-grained task context that can drive different latency expectations. |\n| SEM_has_person_entity       | binary     | queries     | 1 if a person name (e.g., “나연”) appears, else 0. | Personalization with named people can increase emotional salience and possibly tolerance for richer processing. |\n| SEM_has_time_entity         | binary     | queries     | 1 if explicit time-of-day words (e.g., “점심”, “오늘”) appear, else 0. | Time references often imply temporal constraints and urgency, reducing acceptable latency. |\n| SEM_has_health_entity       | binary     | queries     | 1 if health-related terms (e.g., “건강”, “칼로리”, “운동량”, “수면”) appear, else 0. | Health tasks can be higher-stakes, affecting both urgency and willingness to wait for accurate results. |\n| SEM_entity_count            | numeric    | queries     | Count of distinct semantic entities (persons, time, systems, key objects). | More entities increase semantic richness and reasoning complexity. |\n| SEM_abstractness_score      | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10; higher = more abstract (here, mostly 3–4). | Abstract queries (general concepts) may require broader reasoning and search, affecting latency. |\n| SEM_specificity_score       | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10; higher = more specific (e.g., “브런치 카페” > “점심 데이트 장소”). | More specific queries often need finer-grained filtering and may justify slightly higher MAL. |\n| SEM_ambiguity_score         | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10; higher = more ambiguous (e.g., vague “장소” vs constrained “브런치 카페”). | Ambiguous queries may require clarification or broader search, impacting both computation and user tolerance. |\n\n### D. TASK & OPERATION COMPLEXITY\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count        | numeric    | queries     | Number of distinct operations/subtasks (e.g., “use data X” + “recommend Y”). | More operations increase pipeline complexity and likely latency. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering        | binary     | queries     | 1 if query implies filtering (e.g., by time, type like “브런치 카페”), else 0. | Filtering narrows search space but adds computation; users may expect some delay. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation      | binary     | queries     | 1 if query implies combining or summarizing data (e.g., health metrics), else 0. | Aggregation over personal data can be computationally heavier and perceived as “worth waiting for”. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting          | binary     | queries     | 1 if results likely need ranking/sorting (e.g., best places), else 0. | Sorting/ranking adds computation and shapes expectations for quality vs speed. |\n| TASK_modality_types         | ordinal    | queries     | Count of modalities: 1=text-only, 2=text+external structured data. | Multi-modal or multi-source tasks are more complex and may justify higher MAL. |\n| TASK_external_dependency    | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=optional, 2=required external data (e.g., calendar, health data). | External dependencies introduce I/O and integration delays, which users may anticipate. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count  | ordinal    | queries     | 1=single item, 2=few options, 3=many options; here mostly 2. | More expected results can increase computation and reading time, influencing acceptable latency. |\n| TASK_personalization_level  | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=uses generic user role (“내”), 2=uses detailed personal data. | Higher personalization often increases stakes and tolerance for more elaborate processing. |\n\n### E. TEMPORAL & CONTEXTUAL FEATURES\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type         | categorical| queries     | “relative” if words like “오늘” appear, else “none”. | Relative time (“today”) implies immediacy and can reduce acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_time_range_specificity | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=coarse (day), 2=fine (time window); here 1 when “오늘” present. | More specific time ranges often mean tighter deadlines and lower MAL. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement    | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high; meal suggestions for “오늘” set to 2. | Higher recency needs (e.g., today’s schedule) increase time pressure. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need          | ordinal    | queries     | 0=offline OK, 1=near-real-time helpful, 2=real-time critical; here 1 for “오늘” tasks. | Real-time or near-real-time tasks support lower MAL thresholds. |\n| TEMP_location_context_need  | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=implicit (user’s city), 2=explicit; restaurant/date queries set to 1. | Location dependence adds external lookup and affects urgency (e.g., before lunch). |\n\n### F. USER INTENT & URGENCY\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level        | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5; higher = more urgent (e.g., “오늘 점심” set to 3). | Urgent tasks reduce acceptable waiting time. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5; higher = more severe consequences (health > date > casual). | Higher stakes can increase willingness to wait for quality, but also increase time pressure. |\n| INTENT_priority_indicator   | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5; subjective task priority (health and immediate meals higher). | High-priority tasks may demand faster responses or justify more computation, depending on user mindset. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone       | categorical| queries     | {“neutral”, “positive”}; date-related queries set to “positive”. | Positive/hedonic tasks may allow slightly more patience than stressful/negative tasks. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality | ordinal| queries     | 0–5; how critical it is that the answer be satisfying (date/health higher). | When satisfaction is critical, users may accept more latency for better results. |\n\n### G. INFORMATION DENSITY\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| INFO_density_score          | numeric    | queries     | Heuristic: (SEM_entity_count + TASK_operation_count) / TXT_word_count. | Captures information per word; denser queries may require deeper processing. |\n| INFO_constraint_count       | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit constraints (e.g., “점심”, “브런치 카페”, “목표 칼로리”). | More constraints narrow search but increase reasoning and filtering. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement  | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5; higher = needs precise tailoring (health data > generic place). | High precision demands more computation and can increase acceptable MAL. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement     | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5; higher = needs comprehensive coverage (e.g., “여러 곳 추천”). Here mostly moderate (2–3). | High recall (covering many options) can increase search space and latency. |\n\n### H. COMPUTATIONAL DEMAND INDICATORS\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size      | ordinal    | queries     | 1=small, 2=medium, 3=large; restaurant/date tasks larger than diet-from-personal-data. | Larger search spaces typically require more time to search and rank. |\n| COMP_index_complexity       | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3; 0=none, 1=simple lookup, 2=structured index, 3=multi-index. | More complex indices (e.g., restaurants + user prefs) increase computational overhead. |\n| COMP_join_operations        | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3; number of data sources to join (user data + external DB). | More joins (e.g., health data + food DB) increase latency and perceived complexity. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth        | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3; 0=shallow, 1=basic filtering, 2=multi-constraint reasoning, 3=planning/optimization. | Deeper reasoning (balancing calories, schedule, preferences) increases processing time and may increase tolerated MAL. |\n\nTotal features: 8 (TXT) + 8 (LING) + 9 (SEM) + 8 (TASK) + 5 (TEMP) + 5 (INTENT) + 4 (INFO) + 4 (COMP) = **51 features**.\n\n---\n\n3. **Expanded_Dataset_CSV**\n\n```csv\nqueries,MAL,TXT_char_count,TXT_char_count_no_spaces,TXT_word_count,TXT_avg_word_length,TXT_punctuation_count,TXT_special_char_count,TXT_contains_parentheses,TXT_text_density,LING_query_type,LING_has_modal,LING_has_conditional,LING_has_negation,LING_clause_count,LING_verb_count,LING_noun_count,LING_verb_noun_ratio,SEM_domain_primary,SEM_domain_secondary,SEM_has_person_entity,SEM_has_time_entity,SEM_has_health_entity,SEM_entity_count,SEM_abstractness_score,SEM_specificity_score,SEM_ambiguity_score,TASK_operation_count,TASK_needs_filtering,TASK_needs_aggregation,TASK_needs_sorting,TASK_modality_types,TASK_external_dependency,TASK_expected_result_count,TASK_personalization_level,TEMP_reference_type,TEMP_time_range_specificity,TEMP_recency_requirement,TEMP_realtime_need,TEMP_location_context_need,INTENT_urgency_level,INTENT_consequence_severity,INTENT_priority_indicator,INTENT_emotional_tone,INTENT_satisfaction_criticality,INFO_density_score,INFO_constraint_count,INFO_precision_requirement,INFO_recall_requirement,COMP_search_space_size,COMP_index_complexity,COMP_join_operations,COMP_reasoning_depth\n\"나연이랑 갈만한 점심 데이트 장소 추천해줘\",36.2261,24,21,5,4.2,0,0,0,3.5,imperative,1,0,0,1,1,4,0.25,dating,restaurant_search,1,1,0,3,3,5,4,2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1,relative,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,positive,4,1.0,2,3,2,3,1,1\n\"나연이랑 갈만한 점심 브런치 카페 추천해줘\",20.0408,25,22,5,4.4,0,0,0,3.666666667,imperative,1,0,0,1,1,4,0.25,dating,restaurant_search,1,1,0,3,3,6,3,2,1,0,1,1,0,2,1,relative,1,2,1,1,3,2,3,positive,4,1.0,3,4,2,3,1,1\n\"내 건강 데이터를 참고해서 오늘 식단을 추천해줘\",28.2162,24,21,6,3.5,0,0,0,3.0,imperative,0,0,0,1,1,4,0.25,food_nutrition,health_data,0,1,1,3,3,7,3,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,relative,1,2,1,0,3,3,3,neutral,5,0.833333333,3,4,2,2,2,2\n\"내 일정(캘린더)을 참고해서 오늘 점심 메뉴 추천해줘\",18.7407,28,24,6,4.0,0,2,1,3.428571429,imperative,0,0,0,1,1,4,0.25,schedule_planning,calendar_integration,0,1,0,3,3,6,3,2,1,0,1,2,2,2,2,relative,1,2,1,1,3,2,3,neutral,4,0.833333333,3,3,2,3,2,2\n\"내 목표 칼로리와 운동량을 참고해서 오늘 식단을 추천해줘\",20.401,32,28,7,4.0,0,0,0,3.5,imperative,0,0,0,1,1,5,0.2,food_nutrition,health_data,0,1,1,4,3,8,3,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,relative,1,2,1,0,3,4,4,neutral,5,0.857142857,4,4,2,2,2,2\n\"내 수면 분석 데이터를 참고해서 오늘 식단을 추천해줘\",21.7058,28,24,7,3.428571429,0,0,0,3.0,imperative,0,0,0,1,1,4,0.25,food_nutrition,health_data,0,1,1,3,3,7,3,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,relative,1,2,1,0,3,3,3,neutral,5,0.714285714,3,4,2,2,2,2\n```\n\nNotes on per-row manual assignments (consistent with definitions):\n\n- Noun counts, entity counts, constraint counts, etc., were derived by simple, consistent heuristics across the six queries.\n- Ordinal scores (e.g., urgency, specificity, precision) are assigned relatively across this small set, not as absolute universal scales.\n\n---\n\n4. **Modeling_Notes**\n\nThese features are designed to be interpretable and relatively low-dimensional, making them suitable for models like gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost/LightGBM), random forests, or generalized additive models (GAMs). Tree-based models can naturally handle mixed numeric, ordinal, and categorical features and capture non-linear relationships between, for example, urgency and MAL or task complexity and MAL.\n\nFeature importance is likely to concentrate on: INTENT_urgency_level, TEMP_recency_requirement, TASK_external_dependency, TASK_operation_count, INFO_precision_requirement, COMP_reasoning_depth, and SEM_domain_primary/secondary. Evaluation should use regression metrics (MAE, RMSE) with cross-validation; with more data, stratified or grouped CV by domain (e.g., train on health + date, test on schedule) would test generalization across task types. Partial dependence or SHAP analyses can help interpret how each feature influences MAL.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\nThe feature set is grounded in human factors and cognitive psychology: text and linguistic features approximate how much information the user encodes and how complex the language structure is, which correlates with mental workload and the perceived “size” of the task. Semantic, task, and computational features capture how many entities, constraints, and operations the system must consider, which maps to both actual computational cost and the user’s expectations about how long such a task “should” take.\n\nTemporal and intent features explicitly encode urgency, time pressure, and consequence severity—key determinants of acceptable waiting time in HFE research. Information density and precision/recall requirements reflect how exhaustive and tailored the answer must be, which users intuitively trade off against latency. Together, these features allow a model to approximate the interplay between cognitive load (complex, personalized, multi-constraint tasks), urgency (e.g., “today’s lunch”), and trust/expectation (e.g., external data use), providing a rich basis for predicting Maximum Acceptable Latency."
