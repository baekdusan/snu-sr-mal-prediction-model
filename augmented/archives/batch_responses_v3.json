The goal is to engineer a rich set of interpretable features (textual, linguistic, semantic, task, temporal, intent, information, and computational) that can help a downstream model predict MAL. The features are grounded in human factors and cognitive psychology, capturing how query complexity, urgency, and task demands shape acceptable waiting time.\n\n---\n\n2. **Feature_Specification**\n\nBelow, each feature follows the required schema and naming, grouped by category.\n\n### A. Basic Text Statistics\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| TXT_char_count                 | numeric   | queries     | Total number of characters including spaces. | Longer queries often imply more complex intent and higher cognitive processing, which can increase tolerance for latency. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces       | numeric   | queries     | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures raw textual length; relates to information volume and potential processing time. |\n| TXT_word_count                 | numeric   | queries     | Number of whitespace-separated tokens. | More words generally mean more constraints or detail, affecting both system effort and user expectations. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length            | numeric   | queries     | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count. | Longer average word length can indicate more technical or specific language, often tied to higher task complexity. |\n| TXT_sentence_count             | numeric   | queries     | Count of sentences (here all are single-sentence → 1). | More sentences usually mean multi-part tasks; even if constant here, it’s useful for broader datasets. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count          | numeric   | queries     | Count of punctuation characters (e.g., “?”, “,”). | Punctuation can signal interrogatives, lists, or complexity, influencing perceived task difficulty. |\n| TXT_special_char_count         | numeric   | queries     | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., digits, “원”). | Special characters (numbers, currency) often indicate precise constraints, affecting information density. |\n| TXT_text_density               | numeric   | queries     | TXT_word_count / TXT_sentence_count. | Words per sentence approximate density; denser queries may require more reasoning and allow more latency. |\n\n### B. Linguistic & Syntactic Features\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| LING_query_type                | categorical | queries   | “interrogative” if question-like (ending with “?”, “뭐였지?”, “어디였지?” etc.), else “imperative”. | Query type affects user expectations: questions often expect faster clarification; commands may tolerate more processing. |\n| LING_tense                     | categorical | queries   | Dominant tense: “past”, “present”, or “future” based on temporal markers (e.g., “지난주”, “내일”, “작년”). | Temporal framing influences urgency and recency needs, impacting acceptable latency. |\n| LING_has_modality              | binary    | queries     | 1 if modal/epistemic forms like “~겠지”, “~기로 했지” appear, else 0. | Modality reflects uncertainty or planning, which can change how long users are willing to wait. |\n| LING_has_negation              | binary    | queries     | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”, “없”) appears, else 0. | Negation increases processing complexity and ambiguity, potentially increasing acceptable latency. |\n| LING_has_conditional           | binary    | queries     | 1 if conditional markers (e.g., “면”, “다면”) appear, else 0. | Conditionals imply multi-branch reasoning, often increasing cognitive load and tolerance for delay. |\n| LING_clause_complexity         | ordinal   | queries     | 1–3 scale: 1=simple clause, 2=one subordinate/relative clause, 3=multiple clauses; here relative phrases like “찍어둔”, “추천했던” → 2. | More complex clause structure increases mental parsing effort, often aligning with higher MAL. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio           | numeric   | queries     | Approx. count of verbs / count of nouns (estimated from Korean content words). | Higher verb density suggests more actions/operations; noun-heavy queries are more object/lookup oriented. |\n\n### C. Semantic & Domain Features\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary             | categorical | queries   | Main domain: e.g., “media”, “finance”, “shopping”, “events”, “personal_media”, “music”, “location”. | Domain affects typical search space, user expectations, and criticality (e.g., finance vs. entertainment). |\n| SEM_domain_secondary           | categorical | queries   | Secondary domain if present (e.g., “memory_recall”, “social”), else “none”. | Captures multi-domain tasks (e.g., recall + media), which are often more complex. |\n| SEM_entity_person_count        | numeric   | queries     | Count of distinct person names or roles (e.g., “소연이”, “지민이”, “지원이”). | Person entities often imply social importance; more people can increase stakes and acceptable latency. |\n| SEM_entity_time_count          | numeric   | queries     | Count of explicit time expressions (e.g., “지난주”, “어제”, “4월 1일”, “작년 겨울”). | Temporal entities drive recency and historical search needs, affecting computational effort. |\n| SEM_entity_object_count        | numeric   | queries     | Count of distinct concrete objects (e.g., “사진”, “영상”, “와인”, “패딩”). | More objects usually mean broader search and higher information load. |\n| SEM_abstractness_score         | ordinal   | queries     | 0–10: 0=fully concrete (photos, receipts), 10=highly abstract; here mostly 2–4. | Abstract queries require more inference and conceptual reasoning, often increasing latency tolerance. |\n| SEM_specificity_score          | ordinal   | queries     | 0–10: how specific the target is (exact item/time vs vague); higher=more specific. | High specificity narrows search space but raises precision expectations, impacting MAL. |\n| SEM_ambiguity_score            | ordinal   | queries     | 0–10: perceived ambiguity; higher=more ambiguous. | Ambiguous queries require disambiguation and deeper reasoning, increasing acceptable latency. |\n\n### D. Task & Operation Complexity\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count           | numeric   | queries     | Number of distinct operations (e.g., search, filter, recall, aggregate); typically 1–3. | More operations increase cognitive and computational load, often raising MAL. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering           | binary    | queries     | 1 if query implies filtering by time, person, type, etc., else 0. | Filtering adds complexity and search cost, which users may accept with more latency. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation         | binary    | queries     | 1 if query requires summarizing/aggregating multiple items (e.g., “다 보여줘”), else 0. | Aggregation tasks are heavier and often tolerated with longer waits. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting             | binary    | queries     | 1 if explicit/implicit ordering is needed (e.g., “반복해서 들은 노래”), else 0. | Sorting increases computational work and can justify higher latency. |\n| TASK_modality_types            | categorical | queries   | Dominant modality: “image”, “video”, “text_note”, “transaction”, “music”, “location”. | Different modalities have different retrieval and processing costs, affecting MAL. |\n| TASK_external_dependency       | ordinal   | queries     | 0=no external data, 1=optional, 2=required (e.g., bank records, streaming history). | External dependencies increase latency risk and user tolerance. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count     | categorical | queries   | “single”, “few”, or “many” based on phrasing (“다 보여줘” → “many”). | Users tolerate more latency when expecting many results vs. a single fact. |\n\n### E. Temporal & Contextual Features\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type            | categorical | queries   | “absolute” (e.g., “4월 1일”), “relative” (e.g., “지난주”, “어제”, “내일”), or “none”. | Temporal reference type shapes search strategy and recency expectations. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity         | ordinal   | queries     | 0–3: 0=none, 1=coarse (season/year), 2=medium (week/relative), 3=exact date/time. | More specific ranges narrow search but increase precision expectations. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement       | ordinal   | queries     | 0–3: 0=none, 1=low (years), 2=medium (months), 3=high (days/now). | High recency needs (e.g., “어제”) often reduce acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need             | binary    | queries     | 1 if answer must reflect real-time state; here all 0 (historical/lookup). | Real-time needs typically reduce MAL; included for generality. |\n| TEMP_location_context_need     | binary    | queries     | 1 if location context is central (e.g., “어디였지?”, “코스”), else 0. | Location-based tasks may require spatial search, affecting computational load. |\n\n### F. User Intent & Urgency\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level           | ordinal   | queries     | 0–5: perceived urgency; finance/meeting-related higher, media recall lower. | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity    | ordinal   | queries     | 0–5: severity if delayed/wrong (e.g., finance/ID > entertainment). | More severe consequences reduce MAL. |\n| INTENT_priority_indicator      | ordinal   | queries     | 0–5: how high-priority the task seems in daily life. | Higher priority tasks demand faster responses. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone          | categorical | queries   | “neutral”, “curious”, “planning”, etc.; here mostly “curious” or “planning”. | Emotional tone shapes patience and perceived waiting cost. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality| ordinal   | queries     | 0–5: how critical a good answer is to user satisfaction. | High criticality can both increase expectations and tolerance for some delay if quality is high. |\n\n### G. Information Density\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| INFO_density_score             | ordinal   | queries     | 0–10: subjective info per word; more constraints/entities → higher. | High density implies complex mental representation, often allowing more latency. |\n| INFO_constraint_count          | numeric   | queries     | Count of explicit constraints (time, person, amount, modality, etc.). | More constraints narrow search but increase reasoning complexity. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement     | ordinal   | queries     | 0–10: how exact the answer must be (e.g., “어느 카드로”, “제목과 가수명” high). | High precision demands may increase acceptable latency for accuracy. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement        | ordinal   | queries     | 0–10: how exhaustive the answer must be (“다 보여줘” high). | High recall tasks (show all) justify longer waits. |\n\n### H. Computational Demand Indicators\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size         | ordinal   | queries     | 0–3: 0=tiny, 1=small, 2=medium, 3=large, based on implied corpus (all photos, all transactions, etc.). | Larger search spaces increase computational time and user tolerance. |\n| COMP_index_complexity          | ordinal   | queries     | 0–3: complexity of indices needed (e.g., by time, person, content type). | Complex indexing (multi-key) increases system effort. |\n| COMP_join_operations           | ordinal   | queries     | 0–3: number of data sources to join (e.g., card + merchant + date). | More joins → heavier queries and higher expected latency. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth           | ordinal   | queries     | 0–3: 0=direct lookup, 1=simple filter, 2=multi-step reasoning, 3=deep inference. | Deeper reasoning increases both computational and cognitive load, often raising MAL. |\n\n---\n\n3. **Expanded_Dataset_CSV**\n\nBelow is the complete expanded dataset with all required features. Values are assigned consistently and heuristically from the text; where a feature clearly does not apply, a neutral default is used (e.g., 0,

**Modeling_Notes**\n\nThese features should give strong signal for MAL prediction. Temporal features (TEMP_recency_requirement, TEMP_reference_type), intent/urgency (INTENT_urgency_level, INTENT_consequence_severity), and task/complexity indicators (TASK_operation_count, TASK_expected_result_count, COMP_search_space_size, COMP_reasoning_depth) are likely to be among the most predictive, as they directly encode urgency vs. complexity trade-offs. Text length and density (TXT_char_count, INFO_density_score, INFO_constraint_count) will also help capture cognitive and computational load.\n\nGiven the mix of numeric, ordinal, and categorical features, tree-based models (Gradient Boosted Trees like XGBoost/LightGBM, Random Forests) are good first choices, as they handle non-linearities and interactions without heavy preprocessing. For interpretability, a regularized linear model (e.g., Elastic Net) with one-hot encoded categoricals can be used alongside SHAP or permutation importance to understand feature effects. Evaluation should use cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) with MAE and RMSE as primary metrics, and possibly group-wise analysis by domain (finance vs. media) to ensure robustness across task types.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\nThe engineered features are designed to reflect how humans experience waiting time in context: queries that are urgent, high-stakes, or about near-future commitments (e.g., meetings, money, IDs) are encoded with higher urgency and consequence severity, which should correlate with lower MAL. Conversely, tasks that involve searching large personal media collections, aggregating many results, or recalling past experiences are encoded as higher in search space size, reasoning depth, and information density, which typically increases users’ tolerance for latency because they expect the system to “work harder.”\n\nFrom a human factors and cognitive psychology perspective, these features approximate mental workload (text/semantic complexity, number of constraints), time pressure (temporal recency, future planning), and trust/expectation (domain norms like finance vs. entertainment). By capturing these dimensions explicitly, the model can learn nuanced patterns such as “users will wait longer for exhaustive photo retrieval than for a single transaction detail” or “yesterday’s music queries feel more time-sensitive than last year’s shopping history,” leading to more human-aligned MAL predictions."

    "response": "1. Problem_Understanding\nThe dataset contains Korean natural-language queries and their measured Maximum Acceptable Latency (MAL). The goal is to engineer a rich set of interpretable features (textual, linguistic, semantic, task, temporal, intent, information, and computational) that can be used to model and predict MAL. Below, each query is annotated with 40+ features following the exact schema you specified.\n\n---\n\n2. Feature_Specification\n\n| feature_name | type | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------|------|--------------|------------|------------------------|\n| **TXT_char_count** | numeric | `queries` | Total number of characters including spaces and punctuation. | Longer queries often indicate more complex information needs, which can increase tolerance for latency due to higher cognitive preparation time. |\n| **TXT_char_count_no_spaces** | numeric | `queries` | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures raw textual length and density; more dense text may signal more complex tasks and slightly higher MAL. |\n| **TXT_word_count** | numeric | `queries` | Number of space-separated tokens (Korean eojeols). | More tokens generally mean more constraints or details, which can increase processing time and acceptable wait. |\n| **TXT_avg_word_length** | numeric | `queries` | `TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count`. | Longer average word length can correlate with more specific or technical content, affecting perceived complexity and MAL. |\n| **TXT_sentence_count** | numeric | `queries` | Count of sentences (here all are single-sentence → 1). | More sentences usually imply multi-step or compound tasks, increasing cognitive load and acceptable latency. |\n| **TXT_punctuation_count** | numeric | `queries` | Count of punctuation characters (e.g., `?`, `,`, `.`, `!`). | Punctuation can indicate structure and complexity (e.g., multiple clauses), which may increase MAL. |\n| **TXT_special_char_count** | numeric | `queries` | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (here effectively same as punctuation). | Presence of special characters can signal structured constraints (e.g., units, symbols) that increase parsing complexity. |\n| **TXT_text_density** | numeric | `queries` | `TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count` (same as avg word length; kept as separate engineered feature). | Higher density suggests more information per token, raising cognitive and computational load and thus MAL. |\n| **LING_query_type** | categorical | `queries` | Main clause type: here all are interrogative (`question`). | Questions often imply information-seeking; users may expect faster responses than for generative tasks, lowering MAL. |\n| **LING_tense** | categorical | `queries` | Dominant temporal reference: `past`, `present`, `future`. | Past-oriented memory queries may be seen as less urgent than real-time ones, increasing acceptable latency. |\n| **LING_has_modality** | binary | `queries` | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., “should”, “must”) appear; else 0 (all 0 here). | Modality often encodes obligation/uncertainty, which can increase urgency or cognitive effort, affecting MAL. |\n| **LING_has_negation** | binary | `queries` | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”) appears; else 0. | Negation increases processing complexity and can signal corrective tasks, which may alter acceptable latency. |\n| **LING_has_conditional** | binary | `queries` | 1 if conditional structure (e.g., “면”, “다면”) present; else 0. | Conditionals imply multi-branch reasoning, increasing reasoning depth and MAL. |\n| **LING_clause_complexity** | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1=simple, 2=one subordinate/relative clause, 3=multiple clauses. Most memory queries with “때/때 갔던/구매한” are 2; simple count queries are 1. | More clauses increase syntactic and semantic complexity, raising cognitive load and acceptable latency. |\n| **LING_verb_noun_ratio** | numeric | `queries` | Approximate ratio of verb tokens to noun tokens (estimated by pattern; memory questions with “샀었지/만났더라/했지” etc. have similar ratios). | Higher verb density can indicate process-oriented queries, potentially requiring more reasoning and higher MAL. |\n| **SEM_domain_primary** | categorical | `queries` | Main domain: e.g., `shopping`, `schedule`, `social`, `health_fitness`, `media_usage`, `finance_spending`, `leisure_travel`, `food_dining`, `activity_tracking`. | Domain affects urgency and stakes (e.g., schedule vs. retrospective media usage), strongly shaping MAL. |\n| **SEM_domain_secondary** | categorical | `queries` | Secondary domain if present (e.g., `location`, `time`, `exercise`, else `none`). | Secondary domains add dimensions (time+location+activity), increasing complexity and acceptable latency. |\n| **SEM_entity_person_count** | numeric | `queries` | Count of explicit person entities (e.g., “성훈이”, “부모님”, “친구”). | Social entities can increase emotional salience and sometimes urgency, potentially lowering MAL. |\n| **SEM_entity_time_count** | numeric | `queries` | Count of explicit time expressions (e.g., “작년”, “지난달”, “이번 달”, “오늘”). | Time entities indicate temporal scoping and recency needs, affecting both computational filtering and MAL. |\n| **SEM_entity_object_count** | numeric | `queries` | Count of explicit non-person, non-time concrete objects (e.g., “패딩”, “호텔”, “운동”, “유튜브”). | More objects often mean more constraints or sub-entities, increasing complexity and MAL. |\n| **SEM_abstractness_score** | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 0=fully concrete, 10=highly abstract; here most are concrete (3–5) as they refer to specific behaviors/events. | Abstract queries require more interpretation and reasoning, increasing acceptable latency. |\n| **SEM_specificity_score** | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 0=very vague, 10=very specific; memory of a particular restaurant/store is high (7–9), aggregate counts a bit lower (5–7). | Higher specificity narrows search space but increases expectation of precision, which can increase MAL tolerance. |\n| **SEM_ambiguity_score** | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | 0=unambiguous, 10=highly ambiguous; most are low (2–4) because they refer to a clear metric or event. | Ambiguity increases uncertainty and cognitive effort, often increasing acceptable latency if users expect disambiguation. |\n| **TASK_operation_count** | numeric | `queries` | Number of conceptual operations: e.g., simple count/lookup=1, compare “지난달과 비교했을 때…”=2. | More operations imply more computation and reasoning, increasing MAL. |\n| **TASK_needs_filtering** | binary | `queries` | 1 if query requires filtering by time, place, category; else 0 (all here are 1). | Filtering over logs/history increases search complexity and user expectation of some latency. |\n| **TASK_needs_aggregation** | binary | `queries` | 1 if query needs summation/count/total time; else 0 (memory of a single location is 0). | Aggregation over many events (e.g., “총 얼마나 썼지?”, “몇 번이나”) increases computational effort and MAL. |\n| **TASK_needs_sorting** | binary | `queries` | 1 if explicit sorting/ranking needed; else 0 (all 0 here). | Sorting adds extra computation and can increase acceptable latency. |\n| **TASK_modality_types** | numeric | `queries` | Number of modalities: 1=text-only (all 1 here). | Multi-modal tasks (text+image+video) are heavier and users may tolerate more latency. |\n| **TASK_external_dependency** | ordinal (0–2) | `queries` | 0=no external data, 1=optional, 2=required (all 2: requires personal history/logs). | Reliance on external/personal data increases latency expectations due to I/O and privacy checks. |\n| **TASK_expected_result_count** | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1=single item (e.g., “어디였지?”), 2=few, 3=many (e.g., yearly counts). | More results imply more processing and formatting, increasing MAL. |\n| **TEMP_reference_type** | categorical | `queries` | `absolute` (specific period like “작년”, “지난달”), `relative` (e.g., “최근에”), or `none`. | Temporal framing affects recency expectations and search scope, influencing MAL. |\n| **TEMP_range_specificity** | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 0=none, 1=broad (year), 2=medium (month/season), 3=narrow (day/week/today/이번 달/지난주). | Narrow ranges reduce search space but increase precision expectations; broad ranges increase computational load. |\n| **TEMP_recency_requirement** | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | 0=historical only, 1=months ago, 2=weeks, 3=real-time/very recent. | Higher recency needs (e.g., “오늘”) reduce acceptable latency because users feel time pressure. |\n| **TEMP_realtime_need** | binary | `queries` | 1 if answer must reflect up-to-the-moment state; else 0 (all 0; all are retrospective). | Real-time needs (e.g., live traffic) sharply reduce MAL; retrospective logs allow more latency. |\n| **TEMP_location_context_need** | binary | `queries` | 1 if location context (e.g., “어디서”, “어디였지?”) is central; else 0. | Location-based recall often involves map/POI lookup, increasing computational work and MAL. |\n| **INTENT_urgency_level** | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | 0=very low, 5=critical; schedule for “오늘” is higher (3–4), retrospective stats lower (1–2). | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency; users are less tolerant of delays when time-sensitive. |\n| **INTENT_consequence_severity** | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | 0=trivial, 5=severe; forgetting today’s meeting is higher (3), not knowing last month’s YouTube hours is low (1). | Higher stakes (missed meetings, money) reduce MAL. |\n| **INTENT_priority_indicator** | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | Perceived task priority; schedule-related > self-tracking stats. | Higher priority tasks demand faster responses, lowering MAL. |\n| **INTENT_emotional_tone** | categorical | `queries` | Overall tone: here mostly `neutral`/`curious`. | Emotional arousal (anxiety, frustration) reduces tolerance for waiting. |\n| **INTENT_satisfaction_criticality** | ordinal (0–5) | `queries` | How critical a good answer is for satisfaction; schedule/social memory somewhat higher than casual stats. | When satisfaction hinges on accuracy, users may tolerate slightly more latency for better results. |\n| **INFO_density_score** | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Subjective info per word: multi-constraint queries (time+place+activity) higher (6–7), simple counts lower (4–5). | Higher information density increases cognitive and computational load, raising MAL. |\n| **INFO_constraint_count** | numeric | `queries` | Number of explicit constraints (time, place, actor, activity, platform, etc.). | More constraints narrow search but increase parsing complexity, often increasing MAL. |\n| **INFO_precision_requirement** | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Required answer exactness: “어디였지?” or “총 얼마나” high (8–9), rough counts slightly lower (6–7). | High precision expectations can increase acceptable latency if users expect careful computation. |\n| **INFO_recall_requirement** | ordinal (0–10) | `queries` | Required coverage of all relevant events: yearly counts high (8–9), single-event memory lower (4–5). | High recall needs (cover all events) increase search space and MAL. |\n| **COMP_search_space_size** | ordinal (1–4) | `queries` | 1=small, 2=medium, 3=large, 4=massive; yearly aggregates or “지난해” queries are larger (3), daily/이번 달 smaller (2). | Larger search spaces require more computation and users expect more latency. |\n| **COMP_index_complexity** | ordinal (1–3) | `queries` | 1=simple index, 2=multi-field (time+category), 3=complex; most log queries are 2. | More complex indexing (time+location+type) increases backend cost and MAL. |\n| **COMP_join_operations** | ordinal (0–3) | `queries` | Estimated joins: 0=single table, 1=logs+metadata, 2+=multiple; platform-specific spend/usage (쿠팡, 유튜브) often 1–2. | More joins increase latency and user expectations of delay. |\n| **COMP_reasoning_depth** | ordinal (1–4) | `queries` | 1=direct lookup, 2=aggregation, 3=comparison (“지난달과 비교했을 때…”), 4=multi-step reasoning. | Deeper reasoning chains increase processing time and acceptable latency. |\n\n---\n\n3.

Modeling_Notes\n\nThese features should allow models to disentangle at least three major drivers of MAL: (1) task/compute complexity (TASK_*, INFO_*, COMP_*), (2) urgency and stakes (TEMP_*, INTENT_*), and (3) linguistic/semantic complexity (TXT_*, LING_*, SEM_*). I would expect especially strong importance from `SEM_domain_primary`, `TEMP_recency_requirement`, `INTENT_urgency_level`, `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_needs_aggregation`, `INFO_constraint_count`, and `COMP_reasoning_depth`, because they most directly encode time pressure and computational cost.\n\nGiven the modest dataset size, start with interpretable models: regularized linear regression, GAMs, or tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees like XGBoost/LightGBM) with careful cross-validation. Use k-fold CV (e.g., k=5–10) and report RMSE/MAE, plus calibration plots of predicted vs. observed MAL. Feature importance (permutation or SHAP) will help validate whether the HF/E-theoretic drivers behave as expected.\n\n---\n\n5. Interpretation_Summary\n\nThe engineered features are designed to map each query onto cognitive and contextual dimensions known to influence acceptable waiting time. Text and linguistic features approximate how much information the user encodes and must mentally maintain, which affects how long they are willing to wait while still “holding the question in mind.” Semantic, task, and computational features approximate how complex the backend work is (search space, aggregation, reasoning depth), which users implicitly anticipate from their understanding of the task (e.g., yearly counts vs. a single meeting lookup).\n\nTemporal and intent features capture urgency, recency, and consequence severity: queries about “오늘” meetings or locations are more time-critical and have higher stakes than retrospective self-tracking of last month’s media usage, so MAL should be lower. Information density and constraint counts reflect how tightly specified and high-precision the request is; users may tolerate slightly more latency when they expect careful aggregation or comparison (e.g., “지난달과 비교했을 때 이번 달…”). Together, these features provide a human-factors-grounded representation that should allow models to learn how cognitive load, urgency, trust in system capability, and perceived computational effort jointly shape Maximum Acceptable Latency."

The goal is not to predict MAL directly here, but to engineer a rich set of interpretable features (textual, linguistic, semantic, task, temporal, intent, information, and computational) that can later be used by a model to predict MAL. These features are grounded in human factors and cognitive psychology, capturing how task complexity, urgency, and information demands shape acceptable waiting time.\n\n---\n\n2. **Feature_Specification**\n\nBelow is the specification of all features in the exact schema/order you requested.\n\n### A.

Linguistic & Syntactic Features\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| LING_query_type                 | categorical| `queries`            | Interrogative / Imperative / Declarative (Korean endings like “?”, “해줘”).| Imperatives (“해줘”) often imply tasks rather than simple info lookup, which users may tolerate longer latency for. |\n| LING_tense                      | categorical| `queries`            | Dominant tense: past / present / future / mixed / none.                   | Queries about past logs vs. current state differ in urgency and expected freshness, influencing MAL. |\n| LING_has_modality               | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., “해야”, “수 있어”) appear, else 0.       | Modality reflects uncertainty or obligation, which can change perceived importance and acceptable wait. |\n| LING_has_negation               | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”) appears, else 0.                 | Negation increases linguistic complexity and can require more careful reasoning, slightly increasing tolerated latency. |\n| LING_has_conditional            | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if conditional markers (e.g., “면”, “다면”) appear, else 0.              | Conditionals imply branching logic or comparisons, often increasing reasoning depth and MAL. |\n| LING_clause_complexity          | ordinal    | `queries`            | 1–3 scale: 1=simple, 2=one subordinate/relative clause, 3=multiple.       | More clauses → more cognitive parsing and more complex tasks → users expect more processing time. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio            | numeric    | `queries`            | Approximate count of verbs / nouns (heuristic by Korean endings and stems).| High verb ratio suggests process-oriented tasks; noun-heavy queries suggest entity lookup; these differ in computational and perceived complexity. |\n\n### C. Semantic & Domain Features\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary              | categorical| `queries`            | Main domain: e.g., finance, media, communication, productivity, health.   | Different domains have different user expectations for latency (e.g., finance/logs vs. entertainment). |\n| SEM_domain_secondary            | categorical| `queries`            | Secondary domain if present, else “none”.                                  | Captures cross-domain tasks (e.g., finance + planning) which may be more complex and allow more latency. |\n| SEM_entity_person_count         | numeric    | `queries`            | Count of person entities (names like “성진이”, “친구들”).                   | Personalized or social-context queries often feel more important, affecting urgency and MAL. |\n| SEM_entity_time_count           | numeric    | `queries`            | Count of explicit time expressions (e.g., “작년”, “이번 주”, “어제”).        | More temporal anchors imply more precise retrieval over time, increasing computational and cognitive complexity. |\n| SEM_entity_object_count         | numeric    | `queries`            | Count of distinct non-person entities (e.g., “카드 결제”, “음악”).           | More objects/entities usually mean more joins or filters, increasing expected processing time. |\n| SEM_abstractness_score          | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–10: 0=fully concrete (logs, counts), 10=highly abstract.                 | Abstract queries (e.g., “요약”) require more inference and summarization, often tolerated with higher MAL. |\n| SEM_specificity_score           | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–10: 0=very vague, 10=highly specific (clear metrics, time, entities).    | High specificity narrows search space but also signals high user expectations for accuracy and possibly lower MAL. |\n| SEM_ambiguity_score             | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–10: 0=unambiguous, 10=highly ambiguous.                                  | Ambiguous queries may require clarification or broader search, increasing reasoning and acceptable latency. |\n\n### D. Task & Operation Complexity\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count            | numeric    | `queries`            | Number of distinct operations (e.g., retrieve, compare, sort, summarize). | More operations directly increase computational steps and mental model complexity, raising MAL. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering            | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if query implies filtering (by time, person, type), else 0.             | Filtering over logs or items increases search complexity and expected latency. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation          | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if query implies aggregation (sum, count, average), else 0.             | Aggregations over time or categories are more compute-heavy and users expect them to take longer. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting              | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if query asks for ordering/ranking (“순서대로”), else 0.                 | Sorting large result sets is more complex; users often accept slightly higher latency for ranked outputs. |\n| TASK_modality_types             | numeric    | `queries`            | Count of modalities: 1=text-only, 2=text+image, etc. (all here=1).        | Multi-modal tasks (if present) are heavier and users anticipate more delay. |\n| TASK_external_dependency        | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0=none, 1=optional, 2=required external data source.                       | Reliance on external systems (e.g., bank APIs) increases latency variability and user tolerance. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count      | ordinal    | `queries`            | 1=single value, 2=few items, 3=many items/list.                            | Longer lists take more time to compute and read; users may accept more latency for richer outputs. |\n\n### E. Temporal & Contextual Features\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type             | categorical| `queries`            | none / relative / absolute (all here are relative like “작년”, “이번 주”). | Temporal referencing affects search indexing and user expectations about freshness. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity          | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–3: 0=none, 1=coarse (year), 2=medium (month/week), 3=fine (day/hour).   | Finer temporal granularity increases index complexity and cognitive precision, influencing MAL. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement        | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–3: 0=historical only, 1=weeks+, 2=days, 3=real-time freshness.          | Higher recency needs usually reduce acceptable latency because users feel time pressure. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need              | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if explicitly real-time/ongoing state is needed, else 0.                | Real-time tasks (e.g., live monitoring) strongly constrain acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_location_context_need      | binary     | `queries`            | 1 if location context (e.g., “집에서”, “마트에서”) is essential, else 0.   | Location-aware tasks can require additional context resolution, slightly increasing complexity and MAL. |\n\n### F. User Intent & Urgency\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level            | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–5: perceived urgency (0=very low, 5=critical) based on content.         | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency; users feel more time pressure. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity     | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–5: severity if delayed/wrong (0=trivial, 5=severe).                      | High consequence tasks (e.g., financial planning) may demand faster responses and lower MAL. |\n| INTENT_priority_indicator       | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–5: inferred task priority in user’s life/work context.                   | Higher priority tasks are less tolerant of delay, even if complex. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone           | categorical| `queries`            | neutral / positive / negative / anxious / etc. (all here ≈ neutral).      | Emotional tone modulates time perception; anxious tone shrinks acceptable wait. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–5: how critical a good answer is for satisfaction.                       | When satisfaction hinges on accuracy/completeness, users may accept more latency for quality. |\n\n### G. Information Density\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| INFO_density_score              | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–10: subjective info density per word (constraints, entities, ops).      | High density increases cognitive load and expected processing time, often increasing MAL. |\n| INFO_constraint_count           | numeric    | `queries`            | Count of explicit constraints (time, person, type, comparison).           | More constraints narrow search but increase reasoning steps, affecting latency expectations. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement      | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–10: how precise the answer must be (exact counts vs. rough info).       | High precision demands (exact numbers, comparisons) can increase tolerated latency for correctness. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement         | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–10: how comprehensive the answer must be (full lists vs. top-1).        | High recall (e.g., “리스트 만들어줘”) implies more search and longer outputs, raising MAL. |\n\n### H. Computational Demand Indicators\n\n| feature_name                     | type       | derived_from         | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size          | ordinal    | `queries`            | 1–4: 1=small, 2=medium, 3=large, 4=massive, based on implied data scope.  | Larger search spaces require more computation and users expect longer waits. |\n| COMP_index_complexity           | ordinal    | `queries`            | 1–4: complexity of indexing (simple logs vs. multi-key temporal-person).  | Complex indices (time × person × type) increase query planning cost and MAL. |\n| COMP_join_operations            | ordinal    | `queries`            | 0–3: number of conceptual joins (e.g., logs × categories × time).         | More joins reflect multi-table or multi-source reasoning, which users expect to be slower. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth            | ordinal    | `queries`            | 1–4: 1=shallow lookup, 2=aggregation, 3=comparison/sorting, 4=summarizing.| Deeper reasoning (summaries, comparisons) increases both compute and perceived “thinking time,” raising MAL. |\n\n---\n\n3. **Expanded_Dataset_CSV**\n\nBelow is the complete expanded dataset in CSV format with all features.  \nNotes on consistent heuristics applied:\n\n- All queries are treated as single-sentence (`TXT_sentence_count=1`).\n- All end with a question/request marker, so `LING_query_type` is either “interrogative” (ends with “?”) or “imperative” (ends with “해줘/알려줘/만들어줘/작성해줘/정리해줘” without “?”).\n- Temporal expressions like “작년, 올해, 지난달, 이번 달, 이번 주, 어제, 이번주” are counted in `SEM_entity_time_count` and mapped to `TEMP_reference_type=relative`.\n- Comparison phrases (“비교해줘”, “보다”, “평소보다”) increase `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_needs_aggregation`, `COMP_reasoning_depth`.\n- List/sort phrases (“순서대로 알려줘”, “리스트 만들어줘”) increase `TASK_needs_sorting`, `TASK_expected_result_count`, `INFO_recall_requirement`.\n- Summarization phrases (“요약해줘”, “요약 정리해줘”) set higher `COMP_reasoning_depth` and `SEM_abstractness_score`.\n\n```csv\nqueries,MAL,TXT_char_count,TXT_char_count_no_spaces,TXT_word_count,TXT_avg_word_length,TXT_sentence_count,TXT_punctuation_count,TXT_special_char_count,TXT_text_density,LING_query_type,LING_tense,LING_has_modality,LING_has_negation,LING_has_conditional,LING_clause_complexity,LING_verb_noun_ratio,SEM_domain_primary,SEM_domain_secondary,SEM_entity_person_count,SEM_entity_time_count,SEM_entity_object_count,SEM_abstractness_score,SEM_specificity_score,SEM_ambiguity_score,TASK_operation_count,TASK_needs_filtering,TASK_needs_aggregation,TASK_needs_sorting,TASK_modality_types,TASK_external_dependency,TASK_expected_result_count,TEMP_reference_type,TEMP_range_specificity,TEMP_recency_requirement,TEMP_realtime_need,TEMP_location_context_need,INTENT_urgency_level,INTENT_consequence_severity,INTENT_priority_indicator,INTENT_emotional_tone,INTENT_satisfaction_criticality,INFO_density_score,INFO_constraint_count,INFO_precision_requirement,INFO_recall_requirement,COMP_search_space_size,COMP_index_complexity,COMP_join_operations,COMP_reasoning_depth\n\"작년과

**Modeling_Notes**\n\nThese features should allow models to disentangle several key drivers of MAL: text length and density (processing time expectations), domain and task type (e.g., finance vs. media vs. summarization), temporal specificity and recency (freshness expectations), and intent/urgency (time pressure). I would expect especially strong contributions from: `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_expected_result_count`, `COMP_reasoning_depth`, `SEM_domain_primary`, `TEMP_recency_requirement`, and `INTENT_urgency_level`.\n\nGiven the modest dataset size, start with interpretable models: regularized linear regression (e.g., Elastic Net), tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees like XGBoost/LightGBM), and possibly Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for smooth non-linear effects. Use k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5–10 folds) with stratification on MAL quantiles, and evaluate with RMSE/MAE plus calibration plots to ensure predicted MAL aligns with observed distributions.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\nThe feature set is designed to map each query into dimensions that human factors research shows are critical for time perception and acceptable waiting: cognitive load (text length, clause complexity, information density), task complexity (operations, aggregation, sorting, reasoning depth), and contextual constraints (time specificity, domain, external dependencies). When a query implies more internal “thinking” (summarization, comparisons, multi-step aggregation), users generally expect and accept longer latency, which is captured by higher `COMP_reasoning_depth`, `TASK_operation_count`, and related features.\n\nAt the same time, urgency and consequence severity (`INTENT_urgency_level`, `INTENT_consequence_severity`, `TEMP_recency_requirement`) capture situations where users feel time pressure or where delays have higher subjective cost, which tends to lower MAL even for complex tasks. By combining these dimensions, the engineered features allow downstream models to approximate how users trade off speed vs. quality and effort, leading to more robust and human-aligned MAL predictions."

The goal is to engineer a rich set of interpretable features (textual, linguistic, semantic, task, temporal, intent, information, and computational) that can help a downstream model predict MAL. These features are grounded in human factors and cognitive psychology, reflecting how task complexity, urgency, and expectations shape acceptable waiting time.\n\n---\n\n2. **Feature_Specification**\n\nBelow is the specification for all features in the required schema.\n\n### A. Basic Text Statistics\n\n| feature_name                    | type       | derived_from      | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| TXT_char_count                 | numeric    | `queries`         | Total number of characters in the query, including spaces.                | Longer queries often indicate more complex tasks and higher cognitive load, which can increase tolerated latency. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces       | numeric    | `queries`         | Number of characters excluding spaces.                                     | Captures actual symbol density; denser text may correlate with more information and processing expectations. |\n| TXT_word_count                 | numeric    | `queries`         | Number of whitespace-separated tokens (Korean “eojeol” units).             | More tokens generally mean more constraints or detail, affecting both task complexity and acceptable wait. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length            | numeric    | `queries`         | `TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count` (0 if word_count=0).          | Longer average word length can signal more technical or specific language, often linked to higher information density. |\n| TXT_sentence_count             | numeric    | `queries`         | Count of sentences, approximated as 1 for these short queries.            | More sentences usually mean multi-step or compound tasks, which users may expect to take longer. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count          | numeric    | `queries`         | Count of punctuation marks (e.g., `, . ? ! ' :`).                          | Punctuation often marks structure and complexity; more structure can imply more elaborate processing. |\n| TXT_special_char_count         | numeric    | `queries`         | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., quotes, symbols).  | Special characters (e.g., quotes around titles) often indicate named entities or references, which can increase search complexity. |\n| TXT_text_density               | numeric    | `queries`         | `TXT_word_count / TXT_sentence_count`.                                    | Higher words-per-sentence suggests denser information, potentially increasing processing time and tolerated latency. |\n\n### B.

**Modeling_Notes**\n\nThese features are designed to be interpretable and cover multiple levels: surface text, linguistic structure, semantics, task complexity, temporal context, user intent, information density, and computational demand. Features likely to be especially predictive of MAL include: `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_modality_types`, `TASK_external_dependency`, `INFO_recall_requirement`, `COMP_search_space_size`, `COMP_reasoning_depth`, and temporal/urgency indicators like `TEMP_realtime_need` and `INTENT_urgency_level`.\n\nGiven the mix of numeric, ordinal, and categorical features and the small dataset size, tree-based models (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost/LightGBM) are good candidates, as they handle non-linear interactions and heterogeneous feature types well. For interpretability, a regularized linear model (e.g., Lasso/Ridge) or a GAM could also be tried. Evaluation should use cross-validation (e.g., k-fold with k chosen to balance bias/variance given dataset size), with metrics like RMSE/MAE on MAL, and permutation importance or SHAP values to understand feature contributions.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\nThe engineered features are grounded in human factors and cognitive psychology: they approximate how complex, information-dense, and multi-step a task feels, how urgent or time-critical it is, and how much external data and reasoning the system must engage in. For example, summarizing “all photos into a video” or “모두 정리해서 알려줘” implies high recall and aggregation over a large search space, which users intuitively expect to take longer and thus accept higher latency. Conversely, in-situ, real-time decisions like “지금 여기 … 할인되는 카드 추천해줘” or “오늘 목표 칼로리를 달성 할 수 있는 운동” are framed as immediate goals with strong temporal anchoring, leading to lower acceptable latency.\n\nBy capturing domain (travel, finance, media), modality (text, image, video), temporal specificity, constraints (price, distance, time), and urgency/priority, the feature set reflects both cognitive load (how hard the task is to think about) and computational load (how hard it is to compute). Higher `COMP_search_space_size`, `TASK_operation_count`, and `INFO_recall_requirement` are expected to correlate with higher MAL, while higher `INTENT_urgency_level`, `TEMP_realtime_need`, and strong recency requirements should correlate with lower MAL. This alignment between human expectations and system workload is what makes these features suitable for robust MAL prediction."

    "response": "1. Problem_Understanding\nYou provided Korean natural-language queries with measured Maximum Acceptable Latency (MAL). The goal is to engineer a rich set of interpretable features (textual, linguistic, semantic, task, temporal, intent, information, and computational) for each query, then output an expanded CSV that can be used to model MAL. The features are designed to reflect cognitive load, urgency, task complexity, and expected computational effort, all of which influence acceptable waiting time.\n\n---\n\n2. Feature_Specification\n\nBelow, each feature follows the exact schema and order you specified.\n\n### A. Basic Text Statistics\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| TXT_char_count                   | numeric    | queries     | Total number of characters in the query, including spaces and punctuation. | Longer queries often reflect more complex information needs, which can increase tolerance for latency because users expect more processing. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces         | numeric    | queries     | Number of characters excluding spaces. | Captures pure text length; higher values may correlate with more content and cognitive processing, affecting MAL. |\n| TXT_word_count                   | numeric    | queries     | Count of whitespace-separated tokens (Korean eojeols). | More words typically mean more constraints or detail, which can increase both system work and user tolerance for delay. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length              | numeric    | queries     | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count. | Longer average word length can indicate more complex or specific vocabulary, linked to higher cognitive load and possibly higher MAL. |\n| TXT_sentence_count               | numeric    | queries     | Number of sentences, approximated as 1 for these short queries. | More sentences usually imply multi-step or compound tasks, increasing acceptable latency. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count            | numeric    | queries     | Count of punctuation marks (e.g., “,” “?” “.” “/”). | Punctuation often signals structure, questions, or multiple clauses, which can reflect complexity. |\n| TXT_special_char_count           | numeric    | queries     | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., “/”, “?”). | Special characters can indicate technical or domain-specific content, which users may expect to take longer. |\n| TXT_text_density                 | numeric    | queries     | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_sentence_count. | Higher density suggests more information per sentence, increasing cognitive load and potentially MAL. |\n\n### B. Linguistic & Syntactic Features\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| LING_query_type                  | categorical| queries     | “interrogative” for all (requests/questions). | Question vs. command can influence urgency and expectations; interrogatives often allow slightly more latency than direct imperative control commands. |\n| LING_tense                       | categorical| queries     | “present” (all queries are about current/near-future actions). | Present/future-oriented tasks can feel more time-sensitive than purely historical queries, affecting MAL. |\n| LING_has_modality                | binary     | queries     | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., “수 있는”, “좋은”, “할 수 있는”) appear; else 0. | Modality reflects uncertainty or preference, often implying recommendation tasks that users tolerate more latency for. |\n| LING_has_negation                | binary     | queries     | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”) appears; else 0. | Negation increases reasoning complexity and risk of misunderstanding, which can increase acceptable latency. |\n| LING_has_conditional             | binary     | queries     | 1 if conditional structure (e.g., “면”, “다면”) appears; else 0. | Conditionals imply branching logic and more complex reasoning, often increasing MAL. |\n| LING_clause_complexity           | ordinal    | queries     | 1–3 scale: 1=simple clause, 2=one subordinate/relative clause, 3=multiple clauses. | More clauses increase syntactic and cognitive complexity, which users expect to take longer to process. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio             | numeric    | queries     | Approximate ratio: count(verb-like tokens) / count(noun-like tokens. | Higher verb focus suggests action/processing; noun-heavy queries may be more descriptive; this balance can affect perceived task complexity and MAL. |\n\n### C. Semantic & Domain Features\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary               | categorical| queries     | Main domain: e.g., “media”, “shopping”, “finance”, “social”, “food”, “fashion”, “location”, “news”, etc. | Different domains have different user expectations for speed (e.g., navigation vs. entertainment vs. finance). |\n| SEM_domain_secondary             | categorical| queries     | Secondary domain if present (e.g., “personalization”, “discount”), else “none”. | Secondary domains like personalization or discount search often justify higher MAL due to perceived value. |\n| SEM_entity_person_count          | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit person names or roles (e.g., “나”, “나연이”, “재희”). | Personalization around people can increase stakes and willingness to wait for better results. |\n| SEM_entity_time_count            | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit time expressions (e.g., “오늘”, “이번 주말”, “30분”, “늦은 밤”). | Time references indicate temporal context and urgency, influencing MAL expectations. |\n| SEM_entity_object_count          | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit objects/items (e.g., “카드”, “쿠폰”, “영상”, “책”). | More objects often mean more constraints or options, increasing task complexity and acceptable latency. |\n| SEM_abstractness_score           | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10: higher = more abstract (e.g., “자기 계발”, “트렌드”); lower = concrete items/places. | Abstract queries require more interpretation and semantic reasoning, increasing acceptable latency. |\n| SEM_specificity_score            | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10: higher = more specific constraints (e.g., “여기 백화점에서 할인되는 멤버십”). | High specificity narrows search space but increases constraint handling; users may accept more latency for precise results. |\n| SEM_ambiguity_score              | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10: higher = more ambiguous or open-ended (e.g., “볼 만한 콘텐츠”). | Ambiguous queries allow broader interpretation and exploration, often increasing tolerance for latency. |\n\n### D. Task & Operation Complexity\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count             | numeric    | queries     | Number of distinct operations (e.g., analyze, filter, recommend, search). | More operations imply higher computational and cognitive complexity, increasing MAL. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering             | binary     | queries     | 1 if query specifies filters (e.g., “여기 백화점에서”, “늦은 밤에”, “현재 위치에서”); else 0. | Filtering increases query complexity and expected processing time. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation           | binary     | queries     | 1 if query requires combining/analyzing multiple items (e.g., “분석해서”, “기준으로”); else 0. | Aggregation and analysis are heavier tasks; users expect slower responses. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting               | binary     | queries     | 1 if explicit ranking/sorting implied (e.g., “최저가”, “리스트”); else 0. | Sorting and ranking add computational steps, influencing MAL. |\n| TASK_modality_types              | numeric    | queries     | Count of modalities/answer types: 1=recommendation, 2=list, 3=search, etc., summed if multiple. | More output modalities or structures increase task complexity and acceptable latency. |\n| TASK_external_dependency         | ordinal    | queries     | 0=none, 1=optional external data, 2=required external data (e.g., maps, weather, prices). | External dependencies (location, prices, weather) increase latency risk and user tolerance. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count       | ordinal    | queries     | 1=single item, 2=few options, 3=list/many. | Larger result sets require more computation and user evaluation, often allowing higher MAL. |\n\n### E. Temporal & Contextual Features\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type              | categorical| queries     | “absolute” (e.g., “오늘”), “relative” (e.g., “이번 주말”, “늦은 밤에”), or “none”. | Temporal framing affects urgency and expectations for freshness and speed. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity           | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3: 0=none, 1=vague (“주말”), 2=moderate (“저녁”), 3=precise (“30분”). | More specific time windows increase time pressure and may reduce acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement         | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3: 0=no recency need, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high (e.g., “최신 뉴스”). | High recency demands (news, trends) push expectations for real-time performance and lower MAL. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need               | binary     | queries     | 1 if real-time or near-real-time context (e.g., current location, “지금” with dynamic info); else 0. | Real-time tasks (navigation, live discounts) reduce acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_location_context_need       | binary     | queries     | 1 if query depends on user’s location or a specific place (“현재 위치”, “여기 백화점”); else 0. | Location-based services often feel time-critical (on-the-go decisions), lowering MAL. |\n\n### F. User Intent & Urgency\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level             | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5: subjective urgency; higher for “지금”, “현재 위치”, near-term decisions (e.g., where to go now). | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency due to time pressure. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity      | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5: perceived consequence of delay or error (e.g., financial or social impact). | Higher stakes (money, social events) can reduce MAL because users want timely, accurate support. |\n| INTENT_priority_indicator        | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5: how central the task is to immediate goals (e.g., current outing vs. background entertainment). | High-priority tasks demand faster responses; lower MAL. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone            | categorical| queries     | “neutral”, “curious”, “planning”, “cost_sensitive”, etc., based on wording. | Emotional framing (e.g., cost concern, special occasions) shapes patience and trust in automation. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality  | ordinal    | queries     | 0–5: importance of getting a satisfying answer (e.g., gifts, fashion, subscriptions). | When satisfaction is critical, users may accept more latency for better quality, up to a point. |\n\n### G. Information Density\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| INFO_density_score               | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10: subjective info density (constraints, entities, operations per word). | Higher density means more information per token, increasing cognitive and computational load and MAL. |\n| INFO_constraint_count            | numeric    | queries     | Count of explicit constraints (time, location, price, personal habits, etc.). | More constraints increase complexity and expected processing time. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement       | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10: how precise the answer must be (e.g., “최저가”, “할인되는”). | High precision demands more careful search/optimization, increasing acceptable latency. |\n| INFO_recall_requirement          | ordinal    | queries     | 0–10: need for coverage/completeness (e.g., “리스트”, “검색해줘”). | High recall (comprehensive lists) requires broader search, increasing MAL. |\n\n### H. Computational Demand Indicators\n\n| feature_name                     | type        | derived_from | definition | theoretical_rationale |\n|----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| COMP_search_space_size           | ordinal    | queries     | 1=small, 2=medium, 3=large, 4=massive, based on domain and constraints. | Larger search spaces require more computation; users may expect slower responses. |\n| COMP_index_complexity            | ordinal    | queries     | 1–3: complexity of indices needed (e.g., by time, location, user history). | Complex indexing (multi-field, personalization) increases backend complexity and MAL. |\n| COMP_join_operations             | ordinal    | queries     | 0–3: estimated number of data joins (e.g., user history × merchant × location). | More joins imply heavier database operations and longer latency. |\n| COMP_reasoning_depth             | ordinal    | queries     | 1–4: depth of reasoning (1=simple lookup, 2=filtering, 3=aggregation, 4=personalized analysis). | Deeper reasoning (analysis, personalization) increases processing time and acceptable latency. |\n\n---\n\n3.

Modeling_Notes\n\nThese features should give strong signal for MAL prediction. I would expect:\n\n- High importance from: `TASK_operation_count`, `TASK_external_dependency`, `COMP_reasoning_depth`, `COMP_search_space_size`, `INFO_constraint_count`, `INTENT_urgency_level`, `TEMP_realtime_need`, and personalization-related semantics (`SEM_domain_secondary` = personalization/discount).\n- Text length and density (`TXT_*`) will matter but likely less than task/intent features once the model has enough data.\n- Domain and temporal features (`SEM_domain_primary`, `TEMP_recency_requirement`) will capture different baseline expectations (e.g., news vs. entertainment vs. shopping).\n\nRecommended model families:\n\n- Start with tree-based models (Gradient Boosted Trees like XGBoost/LightGBM or Random Forests) for interpretability via feature importance and partial dependence.\n- For more subtle interactions, consider a small neural network or GAM (generalized additive model) with monotonic constraints on some features (e.g., higher urgency → lower MAL).\n\nEvaluation:\n\n- Use k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) due to modest dataset size.\n- Optimize regression metrics: RMSE and MAE on MAL.\n- Inspect calibration plots and residuals by domain and urgency level to ensure the model behaves sensibly across contexts.\n\n---\n\n5. Interpretation_Summary\n\nThe engineered features are designed to map each query into dimensions that reflect human cognitive load, urgency, and expectations of system effort. Text and linguistic features approximate how complex the query is to parse; semantic and task features capture how many constraints, entities, and operations are involved; temporal and intent features encode time pressure, stakes, and emotional framing; information and computational features approximate backend workload and reasoning depth.\n\nFrom a human factors perspective, users are generally more tolerant of latency when tasks are complex, personalized, or high-stakes but not extremely urgent (e.g., analyzing past behavior to recommend subscriptions or gifts). Conversely, real-time, location-based, or time-critical decisions (e.g., where to go now, current discounts at “here” locations, latest news) lower acceptable latency. This feature set is structured so that a model can learn these patterns: higher `COMP_reasoning_depth`, `TASK_operation_count`, and `INFO_density_score` should correlate with higher MAL, while higher `INTENT_urgency_level`, `TEMP_realtime_need`, and `TEMP_recency_requirement` should correlate with lower MAL, all modulated by domain and personalization context."

The goal is to engineer a rich set of interpretable features (textual, linguistic, semantic, task, temporal, intent, information, and computational) for each query to support modeling MAL. The output is an expanded CSV where each query is annotated with these features, without predicting MAL itself.\n\n---\n\n2. **Feature_Specification**\n\nBelow is the specification for each feature in the required schema.\n\n### A. Basic Text Statistics\n\n| feature_name                   | type       | derived_from     | definition                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| TXT_char_count                 | numeric    | `queries`        | Total number of characters including spaces and punctuation.              | Longer queries often indicate more complex tasks, which can increase tolerated latency due to higher cognitive preparation time. |\n| TXT_char_count_no_spaces       | numeric    | `queries`        | Number of characters excluding spaces.                                     | Captures information density independent of spacing; denser text may reflect more constraints and complexity. |\n| TXT_word_count                 | numeric    | `queries`        | Number of whitespace-separated tokens (Korean “eojeol” units).             | More tokens usually mean more information and subgoals, increasing processing expectations and acceptable latency. |\n| TXT_avg_word_length            | numeric    | `queries`        | TXT_char_count_no_spaces / TXT_word_count.                                 | Longer average token length can correlate with more specific or technical content, potentially increasing cognitive and computational load. |\n| TXT_sentence_count             | numeric    | `queries`        | Count of sentences, approximated by terminal punctuation (e.g., “.”, “?”, “!”); here all are 1. | Multi-sentence queries often encode multi-step tasks, which users expect to take longer. |\n| TXT_punctuation_count          | numeric    | `queries`        | Count of punctuation characters (commas, parentheses, etc.).               | Punctuation often marks structure (lists, conditions), which can signal task complexity and more acceptable latency. |\n| TXT_special_char_count         | numeric    | `queries`        | Count of non-alphanumeric, non-space characters (e.g., parentheses).       | Special characters often indicate references to external systems or structured data, implying more complex processing. |\n| TXT_text_density               | numeric    | `queries`        | TXT_word_count / TXT_sentence_count.                                       | Higher density per sentence suggests more information per unit, increasing cognitive load and tolerance for latency. |\n\n### B. Linguistic & Syntactic Features\n\n| feature_name            | type        | derived_from | definition                                                                                   | theoretical_rationale |\n|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| LING_query_type         | categorical | `queries`    | Main clause type: `interrogative` (question), `imperative`, or `declarative`. All here: interrogative (“…추천해줘”). | Questions with explicit “do X for me” framing can imply service expectations and influence acceptable wait. |\n| LING_tense              | categorical | `queries`    | Dominant tense: `present`, `past`, `future`, or `none`. Here: present (today, current state). | Present-oriented tasks often feel more time-sensitive, lowering MAL compared to historical analysis. |\n| LING_has_modality       | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if modal-like expressions (e.g., “should”, “can”) appear; 0 otherwise. All 0 here.         | Modality can signal uncertainty or optionality, which may increase tolerance for slower, more thoughtful responses. |\n| LING_has_negation       | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if explicit negation (e.g., “안”, “못”) appears; 0 otherwise. All 0 here.                   | Negation increases logical complexity and reasoning demands, potentially increasing acceptable latency. |\n| LING_has_conditional    | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if conditional structures (“if”, “면”, “다면”) appear; 0 otherwise. All 0 here.             | Conditionals encode branching logic and multi-scenario reasoning, which users may expect to take longer. |\n| LING_clause_complexity  | ordinal     | `queries`    | 1–5 scale: 1=simple single clause; 3=one subordinate clause; 5=multiple nested clauses. Here: 2 (simple with embedded noun phrases). | Higher clause complexity increases parsing and reasoning load, often raising acceptable latency. |\n| LING_verb_noun_ratio    | numeric     | `queries`    | Approximate ratio of main verbs to main nouns (estimated by task semantics).                 | Verb-heavy queries may emphasize actions (procedures), while noun-heavy ones emphasize entities; balance relates to task type and complexity. |\n\n### C. Semantic & Domain Features\n\n| feature_name              | type        | derived_from | definition                                                                                         | theoretical_rationale |\n|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| SEM_domain_primary        | categorical | `queries`    | Main domain: e.g., `social`, `food`, `health`, `productivity`.                                    | Different domains have different urgency norms; e.g., health vs casual dining. |\n| SEM_domain_secondary      | categorical | `queries`    | Secondary domain if present (e.g., `health`, `schedule`, `relationship`), else `none`.            | Mixed-domain tasks (e.g., health + food) can be more complex and more latency-tolerant. |\n| SEM_entity_person_count   | numeric     | `queries`    | Count of distinct person entities (e.g., “나연이”, “나”).                                          | Presence of people and personalization can increase stakes and attention, affecting MAL. |\n| SEM_entity_time_count     | numeric     | `queries`    | Count of explicit time expressions (e.g., “오늘”).                                                 | Explicit time anchors often signal immediacy and reduce acceptable latency. |\n| SEM_entity_object_count   | numeric     | `queries`    | Count of key non-person entities (e.g., “점심”, “식단”, “카페”, “데이터”).                         | More objects often mean more constraints and subgoals, increasing complexity and tolerated latency. |\n| SEM_abstractness_score    | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–10: 0=fully concrete (specific items), 10=highly abstract. Here mostly 3–4 (concrete food/places). | Abstract queries (conceptual advice) often allow more latency than concrete, time-bound requests. |\n| SEM_specificity_score     | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–10: 0=very vague, 10=highly specific (many constraints).                                        | Higher specificity implies more constraints and computation, but also higher user expectations for quality, affecting MAL. |\n| SEM_ambiguity_score       | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–10: 0=unambiguous, 10=highly ambiguous.                                                         | Ambiguous queries may require clarification or broader search, increasing acceptable latency. |\n\n### D. Task & Operation Complexity\n\n| feature_name              | type        | derived_from | definition                                                                                              | theoretical_rationale |\n|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| TASK_operation_count      | numeric     | `queries`    | Number of distinct operations/subtasks (e.g., “analyze data” + “recommend menu” = 2).                  | More operations increase computational and cognitive steps, raising expected latency. |\n| TASK_needs_filtering      | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if task requires filtering candidates by constraints (e.g., lunch, brunch, calorie goals); else 0.  | Filtering implies search over a set with constraints, increasing processing time. |\n| TASK_needs_aggregation    | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if task requires aggregation/computation (e.g., using health data, calories); else 0.               | Aggregation over data (health logs, schedules) increases computational demand and tolerated latency. |\n| TASK_needs_sorting        | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if results must be ranked/sorted (e.g., “best”, “추천” implies ranking); else 0.                     | Sorting/ranking implies comparative evaluation, which users may accept as slower. |\n| TASK_modality_types       | ordinal     | `queries`    | Count of modalities involved: 1=text only; >1 if images, audio, etc. Here all 1.                       | Multi-modal tasks (e.g., images + text) are heavier and users expect more latency. |\n| TASK_external_dependency  | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0=none, 1=optional, 2=required access to external data (e.g., calendar, health data).                 | External dependencies (APIs, databases) add latency sources and shape user expectations. |\n| TASK_expected_result_count| ordinal     | `queries`    | 1=single result, 2=few options, 3=many options. Recommendations here: 2 (few) or 3 (many) as appropriate. | More expected results imply broader search and more processing, increasing acceptable latency. |\n\n### E. Temporal & Contextual Features\n\n| feature_name                 | type        | derived_from | definition                                                                                 | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| TEMP_reference_type         | categorical | `queries`    | `absolute` (specific date/time), `relative` (e.g., “오늘”), or `none`.                     | Temporal anchoring affects urgency; “today” implies near-term need and lower MAL. |\n| TEMP_range_specificity      | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–5: 0=no time, 5=very precise (exact time). “오늘” ≈ 3 (day-level).                        | More specific time windows increase perceived time pressure. |\n| TEMP_recency_requirement    | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–5: how fresh data must be (0=anytime, 5=real-time). Health/schedule-based today ≈ 4.     | High recency needs (real-time) reduce acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_realtime_need          | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if real-time/near-real-time data is required; else 0. Here: 0 (near-term but not real-time). | Real-time requirements strongly constrain acceptable latency. |\n| TEMP_location_context_need  | binary      | `queries`    | 1 if location context (e.g., nearby restaurants) is implicitly needed; else 0.             | Location-aware tasks may involve external services and maps, affecting latency expectations. |\n\n### F. User Intent & Urgency\n\n| feature_name                    | type        | derived_from | definition                                                                                     | theoretical_rationale |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| INTENT_urgency_level           | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–5: subjective urgency (0=none, 5=critical). Lunch “today” ≈ 3–4; health-linked slightly higher. | Higher urgency reduces acceptable latency; users feel more time pressure. |\n| INTENT_consequence_severity    | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–5: impact if delayed/incorrect (0=trivial, 5=severe). Health-related diet > casual date spot. | Higher stakes (health, commitments) reduce tolerance for delay and errors. |\n| INTENT_priority_indicator      | ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–5: how central this task is likely to be in user’s current goals.                           | Higher priority tasks get less acceptable latency; users want them done quickly. |\n| INTENT_emotional_tone          | categorical | `queries`    | Overall tone: `neutral`, `positive`, `anxious`, etc. Here: `positive` (friendly “추천해줘”).   | Positive/relaxed tone may slightly increase tolerance vs anxious/urgent tone. |\n| INTENT_satisfaction_criticality| ordinal     | `queries`    | 0–5: importance of high-quality answer for satisfaction. Recommendations ≈ 3–4.               | When satisfaction hinges on quality, users may accept slightly more latency for better results. |\n\n### G. Information Density\n\n| feature_name                 | type    | derived_from | definition                                                                                         | theoretical_rationale |\n|-----------------------------|---------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| INFO_density_score          | ordinal | `queries`    | 0–10: subjective info density (constraints per word).                                             | Denser queries imply more constraints per token, increasing reasoning and acceptable latency. |\n| INFO_constraint_count       | numeric | `queries`    | Count of explicit constraints (e.g., “점심”, “브런치”, “오늘”, “칼로리”).                           | More constraints increase search narrowing and computational effort. |\n| INFO_precision_requirement  | ordinal | `queries`    | 0–10: how precise/specific the answer must be.

Features like `INTENT_urgency_level`, `TEMP_recency_requirement`, and `SEM_domain_primary` should be strong predictors of lower MAL, while `TASK_operation_count`, `INFO_constraint_count`, and `COMP_reasoning_depth` should correlate with higher tolerated MAL.\n\nGiven the mix of numeric, ordinal, and categorical variables and the small dataset size in this example, interpretable models such as regularized linear regression, generalized additive models, or tree-based models (e.g., gradient boosting with monotonic constraints) are appropriate. Evaluation should use cross-validation (e.g., stratified k-fold on MAL ranges) and focus on MAE/RMSE, plus inspection of feature importances and partial dependence to ensure behavior aligns with HF/E expectations.\n\n---\n\n5. **Interpretation_Summary**\n\nThe feature set is grounded in human factors and cognitive psychology: text and linguistic features approximate the cognitive parsing load; semantic and task features capture how many mental steps and constraints the user is implicitly managing; temporal and intent features model urgency, stakes, and expectations; information and computational features approximate how “heavy” the backend work is likely to be. Together, they reflect how users trade off speed vs. quality and how much waiting “feels” acceptable for a given query.\n\nFor example, personalized health-based diet recommendations (`health` domain, high `INFO_precision_requirement`, higher `COMP_reasoning_depth`) are cognitively and computationally complex, so users may accept slightly longer latency than for a simple lunch place suggestion. Conversely, explicit “today” references and higher urgency/severity scores indicate time pressure, reducing MAL. This structure allows models to learn nuanced, interpretable relationships between query characteristics and acceptable waiting time."
