**Problem_Understanding**  
The goal is to enhance a dataset of queries with their Maximum Acceptable Latency (MAL) by extracting a rich set of features that can help predict MAL. The dataset consists of various user queries, each associated with a measured MAL value. By analyzing the queries and their characteristics, we aim to create a comprehensive feature set that captures the complexity of user intent, cognitive load, and contextual factors influencing acceptable latency.
